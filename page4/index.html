    <p>Well-designed figures are invaluable for presenting technical detail,
including architectural diagrams, timing diagrams, data visualizations,
category hierarchies, and many other forms. Yet the simplicity and
directness of a successful figure belies the complexity of all the
design decisions underlying it. Those decisions were specific to the
original context. Pulling a figure from that context and inserting it
into a very different context such as lecture slides will likely
fail. This short post lists the many ways that such
appropriation can fail.</p>

    <p>Any given class is a story. It has a beginning, middle, and end. It
arcs toward a conclusion.  The story can be deliberate and designed or
it can be inadvertent and confused. Ultimately, the story will be
different for everyone in the room. The best that I can do as
instructor is the best any performer can do: Create an environment in
which the audience can participate, hoping that their outcomes
approximate those I had in mind. But what do I do with a prior “story”
when the class I designed for an hour and a half session last year is
scheduled this year for a sesssion of one hour?</p>

    <p>With the developing maturity of chaos engineering techniques, I see
people taking the job title, “Chaos Engineer”. Although I think chaos
engineer<em>ing</em> is a truly useful field based upon important principles,
I am wary of defining one’s job in those terms. It confuses technology
with contribution, creates a silo where we want a role. I prefer a
title like Site/Service Reliability/Resilience Engineer, which
emphasizes the bearer’s contribution to the organization. An SRE may
very well have training in chaos engineering and spend much of their
time using those methods but their role is to improve system
reliability.</p>

<p><em>Post in an ongoing series on the issues constraining service design
 for datacentres. A previous post presented 2019’s
 version,
 <a href="/2018/10/13/data-engineering-design-space/">a design space for data engineering</a>.</em></p>

<p>Starting January 2020, I will teach a course on service design for
datacentres. The roster indicates that nearly all students will be in
a professional master’s program. Most will be in their second semester
of a program in Big Data, some will be in their fifth semester
(including a two-semester paid internship), with a few in other
programs. What are the key principles that should structure such a course?</p>
