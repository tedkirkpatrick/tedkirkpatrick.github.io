  <p>What sort of materials should students read in a professional MSc.
course in computing science? Journal articles? Research conference
papers? Systems-oriented conference papers? Articles from
practitioner-oriented magazines? Blog posts? Wikipedia entries?
Ultimately, what is the purpose of the readings?</p>

<p>I use a broad, eclectic range of sources in such courses. In this
post, I articulate my rationale for my choices. The outcome driving
them is preparing the students for the activities and audiences
that they will perform after graduation.</p>

<h2 id="activities-graduates-are-preparing-to-perform">Activities graduates are preparing to perform</h2>

<p>I think the essential distinction between the goals of an CS
undergraduate degree and those of a CS professional MSc. is what each
strives to develop in their students. Whereas the undergraduate
degree emphasizes development of <em>professional technique</em>, the
graduate degree emphasizes development of <em>professional judgement</em>.
Although the majority of such a professional’s time may be spent
exercising techniques, building and testing systems, the majority of
their <em>contribution</em>—the reason they were hired—will result from
decisions informed by expertise gained through graduate study.</p>

<h3 id="activities-exercising-professional-judgement">Activities exercising professional judgement</h3>

<p>The activities in which graduates of a CS professional MSc.
program might exercise judgement include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analyzing prospective designs</li>
  <li>Assessing the suitability of products (which might well include
open-source products) for current needs</li>
  <li>Diagnosing malfunctions in current systems</li>
  <li>Defining requirements and designing systems to address those
requirements</li>
  <li>Documenting the rationale for an existing design</li>
</ul>

<p>The key skills are <em>analyzing</em> and <em>justifying</em>.</p>

<h3 id="audiences-for-presentations-of-professional-judgement">Audiences for presentations of professional judgement</h3>

<p>The results of the above activities will be presented to one or more
of the following audiences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Other members of their technical team</li>
  <li>Technical specialists outside the team, potentially including
outside the organization altogether at fora such as conferences</li>
  <li>Generalists and specialists in other areas, often including higher
management at the speaker or writer’s own organization</li>
</ul>

<p>The key presentation skills include providing the <em>right level of
detail</em> for the audience and <em>addressing the audience’s concerns</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to the above outward-facing activities, professionals must
also perform the inward-facing activity of ongoing professional
development, staying abreast of recent developments in computing.</p>

<h2 id="what-readings-will-prepare-students-for-these-activities-and-audiences">What readings will prepare students for these activities and audiences?</h2>

<p>The activities and audiences listed above suggest that the most
appropriate readings will be those focused on the analysis and design
of actual systems, systems in production rather than the smaller
research systems used in research to validate a theoretical construct.
The distinction hinges on the paper scope and intent, not the forum in
which it was published. Many conferences will feature a mix of
academic research that elucidates general principles and papers
describing the design of production systems. Both types can reasonably
be called “research papers” but only one seems appropriate as readings
for a professional master’s course.</p>

<h3 id="basic-research-is-ill-matched">Basic research is ill-matched</h3>

<p>Basic research in the more systems-oriented areas of computing
science, typically done in universities, most often takes the form of
proposing a design principle that will improve software quality by
some metric (latency, reliability, security, and so forth),
constructing a proof of concept system, and evaluating that system in
a controlled environment. This work is difficult and requires a team
of research assistants, often graduate students, to develop the
software, both the demonstration system and its evaluation
environment. Such projects can often consume one or more
programmer-years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the research papers produced by such projects are not
well-matched to preparing students for professional work. The mismatch
arises on multiple levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>audience</em> for these papers is fellow researchers in the same
specialist community. Such communities have specific questions of
interest and specialized practices for answering those questions.</li>
  <li>The <em>contribution</em> of these papers is advancing the scientific and
engineering principles for system design.</li>
  <li>The <em>goal</em> of these papers is to persuade the audience of
researchers that the contribution is a substantial and validated
advancement of the community’s understanding.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>structure</em> of the papers requires a comprehensive survey of prior
results, both to demonstrate the authors’ membership in the
community and to justify the novelty of the paper’s
contribution.</p>

    <p>The structure also requires a formal evaluation under controlled
or at least well-measured and documented conditions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are in stark contrast to the activities that the
graduates of a professional master’s program will perform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their <em>professional community</em> is primarily concerned with
delivering software within constraints of time, budget, and team
expertise.</li>
  <li>Their <em>professional contribution</em> is meeting the design criteria
within acceptable tolerances.</li>
  <li>Their <em>success critera</em> are almost exclusively budget and schedule.</li>
  <li>The <em>genre</em> of their proposals and reports is focused on
presenting decision-makers with a select group of the most viable
options, often only two or three options. The author has winnowed
out the obscure, overly risky, or fantastic options. There is no
requirement of comphrehensiveness. Indeed, the overarching goal is
the minimization or management of risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some academic research papers break the mold, pursuing a more
observational approach, such as the University of Toronto team that
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf">categorized the sources of failures</a>
in long-running systems. Such efforts aim to characterize the
strengths and weaknesses of production systems, knowledge that can
directly inform future practice without any period of adaptation from
a proof-of-concept study.</p>

<h3 id="system-design-reports-are-a-better-match">System design reports are a better match</h3>

<p>Conferences such as the
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conferences">Usenix series</a> or
<a href="https://www.vldb.org/">VLDB</a> include many contributions from teams
building and running production systems.  These papers typically
include substantial contributions from teams at a large vendor. Some
examples of papers that I have assigned to the benefit of professional
graduate students include:</p>

<dl class="dl-indented">
  <dt><a href="http://dl.acm.org.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/citation.cfm?id=1281100.1281103">Paxos Made Live</a></dt>
  <dd>The complexities of implementing the Paxos algorithm in a
high-volume production environment (Google).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/p1041-verbitski.pdf">Amazon Aurora: Design Considerations for High Throughput Cloud-Native Relational Databases</a></dt>
  <dd>Adapting a database design for a managed, high-throughput cloud
environment (Amazon).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3359656">File Systems Unfit as Distributed Storage Backends: Lessons From 10 Years of Ceph Evolution</a></dt>
  <dd>The limitations of operating system file stores as backends for a
distributed file system and the advantages of backends purpose-built
to support distributed files (Red Hat).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04452">FoundationDB Record Layer: A Multi-Tenant Structured Database</a></dt>
  <dd>A record layer for a database with a huge number of cotenants (Apple).</dd>
</dl>

<p>The particular advantage of this genre over reports of principle-driven
basic research is that the authors are reflecting after implementing a
full system, with all the complexities of supporting high throughput,
tolerating faults in both software and hardware, and production
deployment cycles.  The authors are reporting the most salient
lessons from the entire process.</p>

<p>Such processes of development, deployment, measurement, and hardening
against failure are the processes for which students in a professional
master’s program are being trained and reading “after-action” reports
about actual systems focuses and sharpens the students’
judgement. These papers also exemplify the pinnacle of the writing genre
the students will perform in their career.</p>

<p>Reading papers such as these is good preparation for the audiences and
activities with which the students will professionally engage.</p>

<h3 id="blog-posts-and-long-form-discussion-replies-are-also-valuable">Blog posts and long-form discussion replies are also valuable</h3>

<p>A third possible reading source is blog posts, which may be published
on corporate sites such as the
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/">AWS Architecture Blog</a>,
personal sites such as this one,
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, or
<a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>. A closely-related format is long-form
answers on discussion fora such as <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>.</p>

<p>As a genre, blog posts are less complete, less authoritative, more
tentative, and not necessarily as well written as published systems
papers published in reviwed fora. They are written in a personal voice
(though this may be tempered when the author writes on behalf of an
organization) and viewed by both authors and audience not as
authoritative statements but as a first draft of ideas. The audience
is typically from the same community as the author and posts have a
“within-the-family” feel, which can include the sort of nasty
arguments that arise in families.</p>

<p>Though these qualities impose a higher interpretative burden on the
reader in the form of cross-checking claims and accounting for the
open bias of frankly opinionated writing, posts such as these provide
information unavailable in other formats. They are timely, specific to
context, yet paradoxically in the hands of informed authors can also
provide background and overview lacking in more formal genres that
emphasize novelty and rigour of contribution over informed
recommendation.</p>

<p>This genre is also likely forms in which students will write
during their careers. Blog posts often serve as an initial form that
builds an author’s confidence and leads to publishing in more formal contexts.</p>

<h3 id="articles-in-the-trade-press-and-vendor-white-papers-orient-students">Articles in the trade press and vendor white papers orient students</h3>

<p>Articles in the trade press and white papers by product vendors
represent another genre, characterized by a tone of hyperbole and the expectation
of great things to come. Their content can be limited, their charged
language tiring, but they can be useful for orienting students to
current industrial concerns, defining terms, and mapping the
contemporary technical landscape. They can also counterbalance the
longer-term focus of research articles by revealing the more mundane
and dated concerns of production systems outside the charmed circles
of well-funded industrial leaders.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-threads-alert-students-to-hot-questions-and-topics">Discussion threads alert students to “hot” questions and topics</h3>

<p>Finally, threads in Twitter and Reddit can be limited use. These fora
may more often promote confusion than clarity but they do have merit
for pointing students to recent longer articles of interest and
familiarizing them with current debates.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many sources of readings that can prepare students for
careers as professionals exercising informed judgement. Of these
sources, the genre of a classic research paper incrementally advancing
long-term scientific knowledge, though a staple of academic writing
and reading, is the most poorly-adapted. Refereed reports of system
designs and expert opinions in longer unrefereed fora such as blogs
are a closer match to the reasoning, audience, and concerns to which
graduates of these programs will devote their time. These genres are
also the most likely forms in which the graduates will ultimately
contribute back to their profession. I think such forms should form
the bulk of the assigned readings for students in professional
MSc. programs.</p>
