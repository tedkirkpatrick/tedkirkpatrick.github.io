<p>This post considers the style of figures and images that complement
the ones I discussed in the
<a href="/2020/01/21/figure-failures/">figure failures</a> post. Where that post
considered figures that represent concepts geometrically, this post
considers images intended to surprise, inspire, and motivate the
audience. When should I use them? When shouldn’t I use them? Are they
of any use at all?</p>

<h2 id="motivating-images">“Motivating” images</h2>

<p>Technical blog posts and presentations are rife with humourous
images. They may be popular memes, funny images, or simply beautiful
images such as a sunset. I think the originating examples were the
“Screen Bean” images,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Screen-Bean-Stick-Figure-Clip-Art-N2.gif" alt="Blobby abstract humanoid leaping and clicking its heels" /><br />
<small>Source:
<cite><a href="https://pixy.org/820926/">Pixy#Org</a></cite>. This version CCO Public Domain
(according to Pixy#Org).</small></p>

<p>which were
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/05/28/absolute-powerpoint">created by Cathleen Belleville</a>
for  Microsoft PowerPoint and rapidly became
ubiquitous.</p>

<p>A more recent (Fall of 2019) example was the “woman yelling at cat”
meme:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Woman-yelling-cat-meme.jpg" alt="Woman in tears yelling at a cat seated at a dinner table. No, I'm not making this up." style="margin-bottom: 0pt;" /><br />
<small>Left to right: <a href="https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a29739536/cat-meme-taylor-armstrong-explained/">Taylor Armstrong</a>, Kyle Richards,
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/smudge_lord/?hl=en">Smudge The Cat</a>.</small></p>

<p>These images serve serveral rhetorical purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They draw the audience’s eye. Large changes in the visual field
are salient, focussing attention on the locale of the change.</li>
  <li>They establish a lighthearted mood. This may be particularly
valuable in a context such as conferences where the audience may be
hearing many presentations in a short period.</li>
  <li>When the images are drawn from a culture shared by both speaker and
audience, they increase the audience’s trust of the speaker.</li>
  <li>They categorize the slide’s speech act in the manner of question or
explanation marks.</li>
  <li>They provide visual variety, in contrast to a wall of text.</li>
  <li>They engage neurological channels distinct from the
language-processing centres, reinforcing the spoken words with
minimal mental overload.</li>
  <li>They enhance emotional impact.</li>
  <li>When the audience expects a presentation to have this feature, the
speaker is meeting community norms and establishing membership
in that community.</li>
  <li>Establish personal style or brand. Some speakers use consistent
themes for images. After multiple presentations, audiences
associate that style with the speaker. Such a style sets a tone for
the talk.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, these images are intended to motivate and
inspire the audience rather than inform them.</p>

<p>For this post, I am going to assume the presenter is using a
slide-based presentation, created by such tools as Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple
Keynote, or OpenOffice Impress.  I acknowledge other formats—I do
not use slides in my own presentations—but the presentations I see
in computing fora are overwhelmingly in the slide style.</p>

<h2 id="they-also-pose-risks">They also pose risks</h2>

<p>Some items in the above list are guaranteed to occur because they
exploit basic properties of human perception and cognition. Others are
socially mediated. As such, they pose risks for the presenter because
the image may not engender the desired response:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Members of the audience may respond very differently to an image
than the speaker expected. The audience may find an image dated,
inappropriate, or mismatched to the occasion.  The Screen Beans were
widely adopted in part because they removed many cultural
signifiers and reduced the human form to a basic shape.</li>
  <li>The image may distract the audience by suggesting topics wholy
unrelated to the presentation. This risk is particularly high
because these images are deliberately selected for their
visceral impact, which can be far more engaging than the more
abstruse topics presented by the speaker.</li>
  <li>They consume lots of slide space, leaving little room for anything
else. A talk format such as the canonical TED Talk, with each
slide featuring an image and single point, may work fine for
emotional or inspirational presentations but is ill-suited to the
more detailed, linear arguments of the technical realm.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-current-practice">My current practice</h2>

<p>In presentations to class, to professional groups, and in my writing
here, I virtually never use these images. In fact, I didn’t have an
<code class="highlighter-rouge">assets/images</code> subdirectory until the last post, the first that
incorporated inline images.</p>

<p>My presentations invariably fall in the category of detailed technical
arguments. This is partly because I think that’s where I can best
contribute but is also because I don’t find the inspirational style
very interesting. I’m inherently skeptical of presentations at
technical fora that claim that any single technology or method will
“change everything”. Yet that claim is depressingly common at
conferences.  Everyone wants to be a prophet, few want to redesign
the schedule for cleaning trash from the office. For the same reasons,
I’ve never found much value in TED Talks.</p>

<p>People reply to me, “So use diagrams that are technically appropriate
but also beautiful”. That is certainly possible, as exemplified by
Eamonn Maguire’s diagrams that I
<a href="/2020/01/21/figure-failures/">highlighted in the previous post</a>, but
that same post also emphasized how difficult it is to create a
representation that is both clear and beautiful under the actual
conditions in which we create presentations.</p>

<h2 id="drawing-the-audiences-attention---but-to-what">Drawing the audience’s attention—but to what?</h2>

<p>The size of these images, the screen space they occupy, mitigates the
attentional benefits from displaying them. When they are displayed,
the abrupt change in the visual field is sure to get the audience’s
attention. In fact, those moments are the times when the presenter
has, however briefly, the attention of almost everyone in the
audience.</p>

<p>The image has done its job by pulling the audience away from their
consideration of their imminent lunch or that attractive person in the
next row but what is the audience <em>attending to</em> in that moment?
Perhaps a vision of a sunset or a meme excerpted from popular
entertainment, with a key transitional phrase, such as, “We can’t have
it both ways!”  or “How do we resolve this?” For audience members
whose minds had drifted from the presentation and were returned by
the sudden visual change, there is no indication of what “both ways”
are in conflict or what we need to “resolve”. Punctuation for an empty
paragraph, vacuous as a row of commas and exclamation points without
intervening words.</p>

<p>While the audience puzzle over what they may have missed in the prior
slides, the speaker moves on to their next point, the grand resolution
of the dilemma they presented earlier. But the audience members’ minds
are in overload, assimilating the missing past points, the
current point, and whatever relevance a picture of a sunset or
the Jack Nicholson
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDpipB4yehk">“Here’s Johnny!” moment</a>
might have to the actual topic.</p>

<p>The presenter used the audience’s eyes to get their minds—but the
power of an image over speech can set those minds off in a direction
unrelated to the presenter’s spoken argument.</p>

<h2 id="other-issues">Other issues</h2>

<p>Some thoughts in no particular order.</p>

<h3 id="images-can-stale-quickly">Images can stale quickly</h3>

<p>It takes time to find the right image and it may not stay current for
long. Memes and other topical
references are flimsy—few things have a shelf life as
short as a pop cultural moment. The image that wow’ed em six months
ago might be a tired joke today:</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2051_RC11/embed_loader.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"mad queen","geo":"US","time":"2019-01-25 2020-01-25"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"q=mad%20queen&geo=US&date=today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

<p>And if you have to think a bit to recover the common referent of “mad
queen” in the second week of May, 2019—well, that’s the point.</p>

<h3 id="gatling-gun-image-sequences">Gatling-gun image sequences</h3>

<p>An image-heavy presentation entails a rapid-fire succession of
disruptions of the primary visual focus. I think the effect will vary
widely across audience members. On the one hand, such presentations
will likely have less focused, coherent content, making them
better-suited to blowsy conference attendees. On the other hand, so
many interruptions would likely disrupt the audience’s tentative
understanding of a subtle, serial line of reasoning.</p>

<h3 id="pauses-give-time-to-assimilate">Pauses give time to assimilate</h3>

<p>One useful role for a slide with an image and simple text is to pause,
providing an opportunity for the audience to assimilate the material
so far. Creating such a moment requires a delicate touch. The
presenter must keep speaking, stay on topic, yet not say anything so
complex that audience members must spend all their attention on
understanding the speaker, preventing assimilation. For similar
reasons, the displayed slide must also be minimally distracting—with
the definition of “distracting” highly specific to the
context. Finally, the pause should not go on too long, lest the
audience’s attention wander.</p>

<p>Getting such pauses right is part of the performance aspect of
speaking, requiring in-the-moment decisions.</p>

<h3 id="why-speak-rather-than-write">Why speak rather than write?</h3>

<p>Ultimately, why do we present ideas orally rather than in writing or
to complement writing? The entirety of this topic would require
several books to unpack and has millenia’s worth of analysis by
writers more qualified than I but I want to consider the localized
issue of how this broader purpose influences the choice to use
“motivating” images.</p>

<p>A partial list of motivations for speaking:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Shared focus and experience</li>
  <li>Generate enthusiasm for the written presentation</li>
  <li>Create an opportunity for interaction</li>
  <li>Adjust presentation of difficult or commonly-misunderstood topics
in response to audience</li>
  <li>Reach audiences who won’t read</li>
  <li>The chance to be the focus of attention</li>
  <li>Engage the audience through performance</li>
</ol>

<p>I am struck by the diversity of these purposes. They emphasize how
different a spoken argument is from a written one. On balance, I think
they argue for the use of “motivating” images, as they highlight
speaking as a performance, which relies on emotional appeal at least
as much as intellectual rigor.</p>

<h2 id="synthesis-matching-performance-to-reach">Synthesis: Matching performance to reach</h2>

<p>I could continue writing, expanding my scope of consideration
indefinitely. This isn’t a question that can really be answered in any
final way. I think this is enough for now. I’m sure to have
many <em>esprit d’escalier</em> moments in the weeks after I press “Publish”.
I may make this a thread of posts.</p>

<p>At this point, I suggest this partial synthesis:</p>

<p><strong>Emotionally persuasive methods such as “motivating” images are
useful so long as they clearly stay within the reach of the original
argument.</strong></p>

<p>By “reach” I mean the implications supported by the plain argument if
it were presented dispassionately on the page without the supporting
emotional machinery. My complaint against many uses of these
images—again, my canonical example is TED Talks—is that they
exploit the emotional content to extend the speaker’s argument far
beyond any reasonable implication of their original observations. A
partial solution is framed as a total solution. Everyone leaves
feeling better because the monster has apparently been slain when in
fact it has only slowed or shrunk.  These are fine outcomes, more
important than sweeping claims that ultimately prove vacuous, but they
lack the sizzle of supposedly complete solutions.</p>

<p>It is inappropriate to use motivating images to bait and switch the
audience to accepting an unsupported claim, while they can
appropriately be used to arouse enthusiasm for a more circumscribed
but well-grounded result.</p>
