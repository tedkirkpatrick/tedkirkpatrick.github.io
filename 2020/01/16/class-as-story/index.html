  <p>Any given class is a story. It has a beginning, middle, and end. It
arcs toward a conclusion.  The story can be deliberate and designed or
it can be inadvertent and confused. Ultimately, the story will be
different for everyone in the room. The best that I can do as
instructor is the best any performer can do: Create an environment in
which the audience can participate, hoping that their outcomes
approximate those I had in mind. But what do I do with a prior “story”
when the class I designed for an hour and a half session last year is
scheduled this year for a sesssion of one hour?</p>

<p>This happens fairly often. Although a fixed-credit class always has
the same number of class hours per week, the layout of those hours
into individual sessions can vary. For a professional graduate class
at the university where I’m currently teaching, the week may be
structured as one three-hour session, two sessions of one and a half
hours, or two asymmetric sessions (two hours followed by one hour,
or one followed by two). Each of these takes the melody of the semester
and inserts rests at different points.</p>

<p>When I began teaching, I tended to think of a course as a long melody,
from Week 1 to Week 14, the material building from basic
concepts to final, integrative activities. I imagined that I could
slice that melody wherever I needed, fitting it to any particular
year’s class schedule. If I hadn’t done everything I wanted by the end
of one class, I simply resumed the topic at the start of the next.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-the-long-melody-notion">Limitations of the “long melody” notion</h2>

<p>The limitation of my “long melody” notion is that I presumed that the
material could be cut at any point with no loss of learning
outcomes. But now that I’m thinking in terms of the arc of a class, I
see that where I cut makes a big difference. For example, a class
might begin with a question and end with an answer. A good question is
easy to state, readily understood by students at this point in the
course, and yield a memorable answer to wrap up the class with a sense
of completion.</p>

<p>In this approach, when structuring the class the first time, I would
design the question and class activities together. The question would
shape the material, both topics and level of detail, while the need
to stay true to the material would constrain the choice of
question. If all goes well in the actual class, it would travel from a
sense of curiousity to a feeling of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Now imagine that the next year, the class session was twice as long. I
could just juxtapose two of the earlier classes. The resulting class
wouldn’t be terrible but it would feel slightly off, particularly at
the join, where there would be a natural end point but the class would
in fact continue, introducing a new question. The sense of completion
from answering the first question would be muted by immediately
introducing a new curiousity. The two questions and their answers
could become confused by the students.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the new year required splitting a longer class
into two sessions, the damage would be even worse. There might be no
natural break at the halfway point of the original and at class’s end
the question would only be incompletely answered.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-affects-course-design">How this affects course design</h2>

<p>These effects are modest but real. I suspect they worsen as the
original class structure is stronger. A mushy class structure will be
less damaged than one with a clear arc. This has the paradoxical
outcome of advantaging weak class designs—whatever their other
limitations, they are the most resistant style to arbitrary changes in
class length.</p>

<p>I do not have a solution to this. There is much more I could write
about the underlying topics. This post is simply to clarify my
thoughts about an issue that is much in my thoughts as I convert a
course structured around equal-length classes to an asymmetric
structure.</p>
