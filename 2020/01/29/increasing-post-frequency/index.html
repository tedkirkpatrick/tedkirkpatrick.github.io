  <p>I have many incomplete threads on distributed systems. How do I
balance my desire for complete and correct presentations with the need
to post more frequently?</p>

<p>A year ago, I began two threads on distributed systems. The first
focused on using the TLC model checker (and by extension other model
checkers) to
<a href="/2018/10/31/exploring-distributed-algorithm-failures-using-tla-toolbox/">explore failures of distributed algorithms</a>. Before
I could get far with that, I set it aside to begin a second on representing Howard and
Mortier’s work on generalized distributed consensus in
<a href="/2019/05/29/distributed-consensus-intro/">PlusCal and analyzing it using TLC</a>.</p>

<p>I have a related thread that has taken months to begin, guiding
students through the code for
<a href="/2020/03/08/difficulty-of-state-machines/">TenCent’s implementation of Paxos</a>.</p>

<p>This spring, teaching distributed systems to professional master’s
students led me to conceive a fourth thread refocusing attention away
from CAP and back to the
<a href="https://kirkpatricktech.org/2020/02/11/meaning-of-distributed-systems/">Fischer-Lynch-Paterson impossibility result</a>.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of dangling thread. Each would require many hours and
many posts. Instead of pursuing any one, I turned instead to writing
shorter, less dense and more tentative posts about topics of immediate
interest, particularly teaching, as that is my primary activity for
the next few months. I wanted to regain the freedom to think aloud,
which I had to restrain while writing posts that aimed for a more
complete statement. However many flaws remain in the published
versions of those posts, I removed many more by repeated passes before
publishing them. The result satisfied me but the process exhausted me
and was partly responsible for my five-month absence from posting.</p>

<p>In coming posts, I aim to balance between these two styles. In
particular, I will return to those earlier threads but accept some
less precise expressions, in interest of producing drafts to develop
the ideas. Once I have collected enough draft sections, I
may return to do a more polished version, detailed and precise, a more
final form of those ideas.</p>

<p>Or maybe not, if I judge the first drafts to be good enough. My
personally urgent task is to break my current deadlock by relaxing the
requirement that posts be as close to definitive as I can
make them and instead accepting imperfections as the price of timeliness.</p>
