<p>Distributed systems are often made highly available by implementing

consensus algorithm such as Paxos. Two popular tutorials from the
1990s describe the basic theory but how hard is it to implement this
theory?  The code from the

the general solution requires more work than it might seem.</p>

<h2 id="the-complexity-of-replicated-state-machine-implementations">The complexity of replicated state machine implementations</h2>

<p>The basic idea of replicated state machines was first sketched in
Lamport’s classic 1978 <em>CACM</em> article,
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/time-clocks-ordering-events-distributed-system/">“Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System”</a>
(it’s easy to miss—see the left column of p. 562),
though many details remained to be developed by others.
More details are provided in two widely-cited surveys: Fred
Schneider’s 1990 <em>Computing Surveys</em> article,
<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/SMSurvey.pdf">“Implementing Fault-Tolerant Services Using the State Machine Approach: A Tutorial”</a>,
and Butler Lampson’s 1996 <em>Distributed Algorithms</em> paper,
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/how-to-build-a-highly-available-system-using-consensus/">“How to Build Highly Available Systems Using Consensus”</a>.</p>

<p>Schneider’s paper is an extremely general introduction, presuming an
arbitrary consensus algorithm, written when the theory was
well-established but few systems were in production.  As such, only a
small portion of the paper is pertinent to the Phxpaxos implementation.</p>

<p>Lampson’s paper is primarily an introduction to specifying and
reasoning about replicated state machines.  He develops a notation
that he then uses to specify Paxos and informally argue for its
correctness. He says nothing about designing the state machines whose
sequence of operations will be established by Paxos.</p>

<p>Schneider and Lampson’s scant coverage of the actual implementation of
state machines implies that it is straightforward, perhaps
trivial, once consensus is established. Yet the Phxpaxos code base
implements Paxos in 
5,184 lines, while implementing state machines in 2,207 lines:</p>

<p>The state machine code is 43% of
the line count for the Paxos code—anything but trivial. Although
line count is at best a rough indication of complexity, I think for
this case, comparing proportions of a single project writen by a
single, small team, it provides a reasonable guide to the relative
level of effort.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that this code does not implement any particular state
machine, merely the abstract structure within which a state machine
will be implemented by inheriting from the abstract
classes.</p>

<p>What makes the code for a general replicated state machine so complex,
even when the algorithm for sequencing client requests is handled
separately? There are several challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The message lengths are arbitrary.</li>
  <li>The abstract framework requires substantial boilerplate.</li>
  <li>The system must provide a general checkpoint mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<p>Addressing these challenges requires substantial code. This
implementation effort was not just in service of Phxpaxos’s users. The
Phxpaxos implementation of Paxos also uses the state machine framework
to solve two common problems in general Paxos, reconfiguration and
leader election. These algorithms do not require the full generality
of the Phxpaxos state machine framework, however. Much of the
framework is only useful for more complicated cases.</p>

<p>I first describe the implementation complexities before turning to
the two state machines internal to the library.</p>

<h2 id="arbitrary-message-lengths">Arbitrary message lengths</h2>

<p>In the replicated state machine context, consensus algorithms
negotiate the “next operation” for the machines to perform. This
requires passing around the full value of the machine operations. For
systems such as replicated stores, the values may be large, even
unbounded. The consensus algorithm must be capable of efficiently
handling values of a megabyte or more. This complexity is not located
in the state machine code itself but spread through the consensus
code.</p>

<p>Phxpaxos provides an option, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options.bIsLargeValueMode</code>, that when
set increases the timeouts used when waiting for message
responses. These longer timeouts are required because longer messages
take measurably longer to transmit. Timeouts appropriate for
shorter messages would yield too high a level of false positives,
decisions that a message was lost when it simply required longer
transmission time.</p>

<h2 id="the-abstract-state-machine-framework">The abstract state machine framework</h2>

<p>Though the framework for abstract state machines does not include any
actual state machine operations, it requires considerable logic in its
own right:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Because the system accepts an arbitrary number of state machines,
not just one, it requires logic for adding state machines to the
active list and locating a state machine’s address given its
identifier, via the state machine factory class,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SMFac</code>. Supporting multiple state machines is
not just an empty generality—as noted above, Phxpaxo’s algorithm
requires two state machines itself, on top of any defined by the
user of the library.</li>
  <li>The state machines require a context data structure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SMCtx</code> for
carrying any necessary state from the proposing client, through the
long sequence of asynchronous Paxos messages, to completion of the
Paxos instance and execution by the state machine, finally
returning the context, including any result code from the
operation, to the proposing client.</li>
  <li>The framework must define method calls for multiple styles of
operation. State machine operations in Phxpaxos can be executed
singly or in batch, in active mode or checkpoint mode, requiring
support of four execution styles.</li>
  <li>Generalized state machines complicate the Paxos message protocol (defined
in file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/comm/commdef.h</code>). The
basic Multi-Paxos protocol implemented by Phxpaxos (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enum PaxosMsgType</code>) requires 10
message types. The checkpointing mechanism required to support
general state machines adds 2 more message types to that protocol
and introduces a separate protocol of 7 types (enumerated values
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CheckpointMsgType</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CheckpointSendFileFlag</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CheckpointSendFileAckFlag</code>). These message types and their flags
must all be handled in the main Paxos logic code in files
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/algorithm/instance.cpp</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/algorithm/learner.cpp</code>. This
makes the implementation harder to read than that of
a pure Paxos library such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libpaxos</code>, which does not include
state machine code. I explore the complexities of checkpointing in
more detail below.</li>
  <li>The framework must provide callbacks to support state machines with
specialized requirements. Phxpaxos supports three such callbacks:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
<li>
        <p>A callback executed after a value has been chosen by a Paxos
   instance and just before it is executed (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StateMachine.BeforePropose</code>). This allows the state
   machine to update the value to reflect any changes that occurred
   during the Paxos rounds. This callback is used by the Phxpaxos
   implementation of a state machine for master election (file
   <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/master/master_sm.cpp</code>).</p>

        <p>This callback is potentially such a drag on performance of the
   main loop that it is only enabled when both a system-wide flag
   (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options.bOpenChangeValueBeforePropose</code>) is set and a state
   machine-specific function (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StateMachine.NeedCallBeforePropose</code>)
   returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>
      </li>
<li>
        <p>A callback executed after reconfiguration of Paxos node
   membership (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options.pMembershipChangeCallback</code>).</p>
      </li>
<li>
        <p>A callback executed upon election of a new master
   (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options.pMasterChangeCallback</code>).</p>
      </li>
</ol>
  </li>
  <li>The boilerplate state machine logic must account for the Phxpaxos
“group” feature. This establishes multiple independent Paxos
clusters running off the same network address, which can be used to
increase throughput. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SMFac</code> factory object and concrete
classes derived from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StateMachine</code> accept a group index and must
select the appropriate state for the indicated cluster.</li>
</ol>

<p>Taken together, these represent a substantial code base simply to
establish the basic framework from which application-specific
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StateMachine</code> classes are derived. Yet this is only the smaller
portion of the state machine code. The largest portion 
implements a feature that only some state machines require and that is
infrequently executed: checkpoints. I turn to that feature next.</p>

<h2 id="general-checkpointing">General checkpointing</h2>

<p>The single most complex feature required by a general state machine
framework such as that of Phxpaxos is a mechanism for taking
checkpoints of a state machine and restoring from them as
necessary. This is complex code and many state machines do not need
such a mechanism—neither of the two required for Phxpaxos need
it—and those that do need checkpoints only use them in the case of
crashes that require the most extensive form of recovery.</p>

<p>Checkpointing is complex, so complex in fact that I have moved the
details into one or more separate posts. For this post, I only provide
an overview.</p>

<h3 id="when-are-checkpoints-used">When are checkpoints used?</h3>

<p>Checkpoints are required in several situations, of which the
simplest case is bringing a freshly-added node up to date. This
typically arises when an existing node has crashed or is taken down
for maintenance and the operators want to maintain the cluster’s
fault-tolerance by bringing the node count back to its production
level.</p>

<p>In this situation, checkpoints provide the history required to
jump-start a fresh machine. The Paxos log may not be a complete system
history because Phxpaxos garbage collects its logs, culling old values
no longer necessary for active decisions. Although Paxos does not need
these older values to proceed, those values are needed to bring fresh
state machines up to date.</p>

<h3 id="which-state-machines-require-checkpoints">Which state machines require checkpoints?</h3>

<p>The amount of data required to bring a newcomer up to date varies with
the state machine. In the case of Paxos itself, the newcomer can use
the most recent value of any active node. If the sender was not the
most current node, the regular synchronization protocol within Paxos
will bring both it and the newcomer up to date using the normal Paxos
messages.  (Phxpaxos message protocols include some shortcuts to
accelerate this process but the principle applies to basic Paxos as
well.)</p>

<p>The same principle applies to the two internal state machines of
Phxpaxos, which record the current leader and current node
configuration. For these machines as well, the only values that matter
are the most recent settings. The history of previous leaders and
configurations is irrelevant.</p>

<p>However for machines with more complex state, the history is
essential. Consider a key-value store. Each Paxos instance sets a
single key-value pair. (I will ignore reads as only the write history
matters in this discussion.) Although for the leader and configuration
machines the latest instance captures the entire state, for a
key-value store the instance only captures the most recent write. A
fresh instance of the key-value store potentially needs the complete
history, incorporating every write made to the store, to be brought up
to date. This complete history is provided by a checkpoint.</p>

<p>To support arbitrary state machines, including those that need more
than the result of the last instance to become up to date, Phxpaxos
must support checkpoints.</p>

<h3 id="what-checkpointing-requires">What checkpointing requires</h3>

<p>You need the following to record a machine’s state and restore it from
a checkpoint:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A way for a node to detect when its current Paxos instance is far behind the
quorum’s and needs to be sent a checkpoint to bring it up to date. This
is always the case for fresh nodes added to the cluster but a subtle
algorithm is required for an active node that has simply
fallen far behind the others.</li>
  <li>A way for a node that has determined it needs a checkpoint to request one.</li>
  <li>A way for a node that has a recent checkpoint to decide to send it
to the requesting node.</li>
  <li>A way for several eligible nodes with recent checkpoints to decide
which will send its checkpoint to the requesting node. Yes, this is
a consensus algorithm within the larger Paxos consensus.</li>
  <li>A way for the current node to transmit its checkpoint to the
requesting node, accounting for potential message loss or
corruption by the network.</li>
  <li>A way for the receiving node to reset the state of all its state
machines to their checkpointed values and then enter the Paxos
negotiations. Note that this may leave the node slightly behind
the latest quorum and it will need to use the standard Paxos
mechanisms for catching up to the quorum.</li>
  <li>A way to ensure that once a node has completed restoring its state
machines from a checkpoint, it will be able to catch up to the
quorum using Paxos mechanisms and not be so far behind that it
needs a second checkpoint.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is worth emphasizing that all this is occurring <em>amidst the ongoing
regular Paxos negotiations</em>.  Although there are no efficiency
concerns for the node receiving the checkpoint, there must be minimal
effects on the nodes activly participating in the Paxos cluster,
especially the one sending the checkpoint.</p>

<p>The subtlety and complexity of the above requirements make it easier
to see why checkpointing code might be longer and harder to understand
than might appear at first glance.</p>

<h2 id="solving-two-common-paxos-problems">Solving two common Paxos problems</h2>

<p>The authors of Phxpaxos took advantage of their generalized state
machine code to solve two problems of generalized Paxos:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Master election: Phxpaxos uses a state machine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MasterStateMachine</code>
(defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/master/master_sm.{h,cpp}</code>) to transition from one
elected master to another.</li>
  <li>Reconfiguration: Phxpaxos uses a state machine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SystemVSM</code> (defined
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/config/system_v_sm.{h,cpp}</code>) to transition from one
configuration of nodes to another.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these state machines are “memoryless”, in that their
most recent instance contains all the history they need to transition
to their next state, so neither of them requires the checkpoint
mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The abstract definition of replicated state machines is simple but a
production-quality implementation is subtle and complex. The Phxpaoxos
code, which implements Paxos and provides an abstract framework for
implementing replicated state machines whose operations are
coordinated by that Paxos algorithm, spends a third of its code
implementing the state machine framework.</p>

<p>The state machine framework adds complexity to the Paxos algorithm as
well as adding new code for the abstract state machine classes. Additionally,
although not all state machine implementations require checkpointing,
supporting those that do need checkpoints adds a complicated
checkpoint protocol to the implementation.</p>

<p>This analysis is not a criticism of the Tencent’s code for
Phxpaxos. Any implementation of general state machines would require
this. The complexity, inherent in the algorithms but concealed by the
abstraction of pseudocode, is revealed when those algorithms are
implemented in detail.</p>

<p>There have been several alternative designs that aim to manage the
complexity by factoring the design along different lines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tencent developed a storage layer implementing a version
of Paxos based on optimistic concurrency. The design is described
in their <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p1730-lin.pdf">PaxosStore paper</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/Tencent/paxosstore">PaxosStore project code</a> is
open source.  Bear in mind though, that the state machine in
PaxosStore is a direct implementation of a restricted case and not
the general-purpose state machines supported by Phxpaxos.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus algorithm</a> integrates
the state machine code into the consensus protocol.</li>
  <li>The
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~taozou/sosp13/tangososp.pdf">Tango Shared Log</a>
is a new abstraction that supports implementing distributed data structures.</li>
</ol>

<p>These alternatives may clarify the implementation of replicated state
machines by aligning the abstraction barriers at different angles but
the underlying complexity remains. Whichever approach you take to
implementing state machines, expect to spend considerable time getting
it correct for the many edge conditions and modes of partial failure.</p>
