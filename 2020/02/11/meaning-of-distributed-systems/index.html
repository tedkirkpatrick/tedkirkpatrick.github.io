  <p>The phrase “distributed systems” has had several meanings over the
last 50 years, from a mathematical topic to a style of
engineering practice to a suite of technologies. What can
we learn from these changes and how do we reconcile these
perspectives?</p>

<h2 id="the-early-days-1970--1995-algorithms">The early days (1970–1995): Algorithms</h2>

<p>The initial work on distributed systems had strong overlap with work
on concurrency and parallism. Indeed, from the perspective of
algorithm correctness, these topics share much in common. Nor was
there a widely-agreed definition of the phrase. The earliest
researchers were mapping this new territory, not altogether sure of
where they were going or how their maps would ultimately be used.</p>

<p>Although early work included the implementation of groundbreaking
systems such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment">SAGE</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(computer_system)">Sabre</a>, and
<a href="https://www.livescience.com/20727-internet-history.html">ARPANet</a>,
the work from that era most commonly characterized as
“distributed systems” is a series of classic papers focussed on
algorithms and their correctness. The literature, even in its early
stages, was large and beyond simple summary and I don’t have the
background to survey it fairly. Instead, I will list a few papers that
I have found powerful and influential. The list is not particularly
idiosyncratic, as these papers are also widely cited by others.</p>

<p>In order of publication:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf">“Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System”</a>,
Lamport (1978).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/">“The Byzantine Generals Problem”</a>,
Lamport, Shostak &amp; Pease (1982).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/focs/1983/542800403/12OmNvAAtFD">“Randomized Byzantine Generals” (abstract only)</a>,
Rabin (1983).</li>
  <li><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/chandy.pdf">“Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of Distributed Systems”</a>,
Chandy &amp; Lamport (1985).</li>
  <li><a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf">“Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process”</a>,
Fischer, Lynch &amp; Paterson (1985).</li>
  <li><a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr.pdf">“Viewstamped Replication: A New Primary Copy Method to Support Highly-Available Distributed Systems”</a>,
Oki &amp; Liskov (1988).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/papers/p225-chandra.pdf">“Unreliable Failure Detectors for Reliable Distributed Systems”</a>,
Chandra &amp; Toueg (1996).</li>
  <li><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf">“The Part-time Parliament”</a>,
Lamport (Published 1998, submitted substantially earlier).</li>
  <li><a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf">“Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance”</a>, Castro &amp; Liskov (1999).</li>
</ol>

<p>This list is not intended to be complete, sufficient, nor up to date.
For learning the practical side of distributed systems, Henry Robinson
(who I wish would resume blogging) has developed a useful starter
guide,
<a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/distributed-systems-theory-for-the-distributed-systems-engineer/">“Distributed systems theory for the distributed systems engineer”</a>
(updated as of 2018).</p>

<p>The papers can be grouped into categories that highlight their
distinct contributions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Papers that prove fundamental limits on distributed algorithms:
“Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events”, “Impossibility of
Distributed Consensus”, and “Unreliable Failure Detectors”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Papers presenting fundamental algorithms: “Byzantine Generals
Problem”, “Distributed Snapshots”, and “Part-Time Parliament”.
Notably, every one of these was writtten or co-authored by Leslie
Lamport, who was awarded the <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lamport_1205376.cfm">2013 Turing Award</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Papers presenting first implementations solving important problems in
distributed systems: “Viewstamped Replication” and “Practical
Byzantine Fault Tolerance”. I think it is significant that both of
these were Ph.D. projects under the supervision of Barbara Liskov, who
was awarded the
<a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/liskov_1108679.cfm">2008 Turing Award</a>
for these and other contributions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, during this first period, “distributed systems” referred
to a community concerned with defining fundamental limits, discovering
fundamental algorithms, and demonstrating the feasibility of these
methods via first implementations.</p>

<h2 id="the-middle-period-1995--2015-engineering-scalable-systems">The middle period (1995–2015): Engineering scalable systems</h2>

<p>Where the “early period” lasted roughly 25 years, the “middle period”
was much shorter, perhaps 10 years, with some overlap of the
“early period”.
The literature for this period is even more voluminous and although I
do believe I have a good knowledge of the key papers, there is neither
time nor space to provide a bibliography anything close to complete. I
will instead list a short sample of papers to illustrate the history
of its development:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/974938">“A Note on Distributed Computing”</a>,
Waldo, Wyant, Wallroth &amp; Kendall (1994).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262b-2004/PODC-keynote.pdf">“Towards Robust Distributed Systems”</a>,
Brewer (2000).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">“MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters”</a>,
Dean &amp; Ghemawat (2004).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub33002/">“Paxos Made Live”</a>, Chandra,
Griesemer, &amp; Redstone (2007).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html">“Eventually Consistent”</a>,
Vogels (2008).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/parallellabs/dean-keynoteladis2009jeffdean">“Designs, Lessons, and Advice from Building Large Distributed Systems”</a>,
Dean (2009).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub40801/">“The Tail at Scale”</a>, Dean
&amp; Barroso (2013).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>During this period, attention shifted towards engineering large-scale,
failure-tolerant systems running in a global network of
datacentres. The abstract for the Waldo et al. technical report sets
the tone for the coming ten years:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These failures
[to support basic requirements of robustness and reliability] have
been masked in the past by the small size of the distributed systems
that have been built. In the enterprise-wide distributed systems
foreseen in the near future, however, such a masking will be
impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eric Brewer’s 2000 talk, a keynote address to the “Principles of
Distributed Computing” conference, emphasized that his company of the
time, an early Web search service, was</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Based on scalable cluster and parallel distributed computing
technology”</li>
  <li>“But [made] very little use of classic DS [Distributed Systems] research”</li>
</ol>

<p>The talk introduced the CAP “Theorem” but twelve years later Brewer emphasized that
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed/">“its purpose … was to open the minds of designers to a wider range of systems and tradeoffs”</a>
rather than to further distributed systems theory.</p>

<p>The remaining papers sample the development of systems addressing the
interconnected engineering challenges of</p>

<ul>
  <li>failure tolerance,</li>
  <li>geolatency—the lag for round-trip communications across long
distances,</li>
  <li>consistency,</li>
  <li>high scalability, and</li>
  <li>high availability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The systems in this period were purpose-built by organizations in the
grip of explosive growth. It is emblematic of the shift that
<a href="https://cis.cornell.edu/career-conversation-tushar-chandra">T. D. Chandra</a>, first author of the 1996 paper establishing the
theory of weak failure detectors, is also the lead author of the 2007
paper on the challenges of implementing the Paxos distributed consensus
algorithm in production. Theory into practice, indeed.</p>

<h2 id="the-contemporary-view-2015--present-cowabunga-kubernetes">The contemporary view (2015–present): Cowabunga Kubernetes!</h2>

<p>The current phase is the inexorable next step, where commercial
organizations package, distribute, and support generalized versions of
the custom solutions from the previous phase. The experimentation of the
early days of large-scale datacentres has settled into established
practice, at least for some common use cases.</p>

<p>The tool with broadest reach, virtually ubiquitous in both actual
datacentres and discussions about managing them, is Kubernetes. This
third-generation orchestration tool, successor to Google’s Omega and
Borg, manages applications organized around a similarly ubiquitous
technology, containers. Whereas Kubernetes is the clear market winner
to the point where it’s hard to even name an alternative, there are
many contending container technologies, aimed at different but related
levels of the underlying stack. As of this writing, the CNCF Landscape
<a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=container-runtime&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">lists 12 container runtimes</a>,
including containerd, cri-o, Firecracker, gVisor, and kata. (By the
way: Do their trademark staffs think they have to pay extra for
capital letters?)</p>

<p>The choice of container runtime is mostly a matter for the platform and
operations staff as, the distinctions between runtimes are near-invisible
to application developers.</p>

<p>Contemporary discussions of “distributed systems”
centre on the practices of architecting systems to run under
Kubernetes, managing Kubernetes clusters, and cooperating with legacy
systems that remain outside the cluster. Development work focuses on
building out those capacities not well-addressed by the current
release of Kubernetes and related tools.</p>

<p>It’s a Kubernetes world and we just have to get used to living in it.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h2>

<p>What does this history suggest? On its face, it is a typical
progression from theory to early production use to commoditization as
a family of related products. But I think something has been lost in
the process: an understanding of the inescapable limits mapped by
the early theoretical papers. There is an easy tendency to focus on
the technology, with all its details and constant change, and assume
that it will in turn address those limits.</p>

<p>That assumption is false. The technology provides mechanisms for
readily building, deploying, and operating such services but the
designs remain as bound as ever within the theoretical limits. That is
what makes these limits <em>fundamental</em>, after all.</p>

<p>Engineers often cite Brewer’s CAP Principle as an example of theory
that is widely-applied. Whether we define CAP in terms of Brewer’s
original formulation or the two theorems later
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/564585.564601">proven by Gilbert and Lynch</a>,
I find CAP’s relationship to actual practice odd and will write a
future post analyzing that (heavily influenced by
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed/">Brewer’s 2012 reflection</a>
and <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~abadi/papers/abadi-pacelc.pdf">Abadi’s PACELC framework</a>). For this post, I only say that I do not
see CAP as a fundamental limit that must be explicitly
addressed by designs. Rather, <a href="/2019/12/31/design-space-2020/">current engineering practice</a> will lead
the designer to accommodate CAP as a side-benefit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I do see the Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson (1985)
impossibility theorem as fundamental: On realistic distributed systems,
the latency of any consensus algorithm is unbounded. Unfortunately, the
theorem provides no constructive procedure to follow because it is
proved by contradiction. This is typical of impossibility results,
which essentially state that no how much you tweak your algorithm, it
will never match your specification. The FLP result is fundamentally
about reducing your expectations to realistic levels.</p>

<p>The FLP result constrains the entire system design. When implementing
a system, it is seductive to see a given problem as a local issue,
fixable by local changes to the algorithm. But if the problem is in
fact that you are attempting to circumvent FLP, a local fix simply
pushes the problem elsewhere. The fix displaces the problem rather
than solving it.</p>

<p>The abstraction and totality of this theorem make it easy to miss when
attending to implementation details. Yet it cannot be ignored. In
future posts, I want to work out how the limitations that the FLP
theorem guarantees in systems might appear as localized
problems and describe how seeing those problems as aspects of FLP can
produce better solutions.</p>
