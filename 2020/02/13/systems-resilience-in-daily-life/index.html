  <p>When I teach a course in modern distributed systems design, I spend a
lot of time on topics such as engineering for resilience and
automating production processes. It turns out that applying those big
topics in the small matters of my life is a big challenge.</p>

<h2 id="some-big-good-ideas">Some big, good ideas</h2>

<p>I teach the usual things for such courses, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test your system resilience and recovery procedures by inducing the failures you most fear
occurring (though Barry O’Reilly advocates <a href="https://www.se-radio.net/2020/01/episode-396-barry-oreilly-on-antifragile-architecture/">considering failures that seem impossible</a>)</li>
  <li>Establish build pipelines to automate routine procedures</li>
  <li>Monitor system health and performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing especially surprising or novel, really.</p>

<h2 id="some-local-small-procedures">Some local, small procedures</h2>

<p>Within hours of finishing a class, I find myself in a situation in
which one or more of the above principles apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transferring lecture recordings from my phone to the course server,
setting the necessary tags, and publishing the page with the links</li>
  <li>Maintaining earthquake preparedness in my residence</li>
  <li>Resorting to one-time backup passwords when my regular
authentication methods are unavailable for some important Web site</li>
  <li>Configuring regular backups for my laptop</li>
  <li>Automating the pipeline for taking a diagram from source form to publication</li>
</ul>

<p>and many other small-scale maintenance tasks.</p>

<h2 id="big-ideas-are-ill-fitted-to-small-slots">Big ideas are ill-fitted to small slots</h2>

<p>While uploading the backup, signing on to the important site, and all
those other small things, I hear myself advising my students in class
earlier that day. Really, shouldn’t I do in my own life the
things I counselled them to do in their profession?</p>

<p>Most times though, the fit is awkward or even altogether impractical. The
reasons vary:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Possible but a lot of work: In the case of uploading lecture audio
files, I am slowly increasing the automation. By the end of the
semester, I might have it down to the absolute minimum of three
clicks and a single command.</li>
  <li>Consumer tools lack the customization of production tools: The
software I use to record lectures on my phone and the software I
use to draw diagrams restrict my control over the names of files
they produce. Production tools such as logging libraries allow
filenames to be customized to a format that supports further
automated processing whereas the consumer tools require manual filename
adjustment to match conventions.</li>
  <li>Testing a full disaster response is impractical: It’s one thing
to regularly test that I can restore individual files from backup
(and I do) but it’s impractical to test a full machine
restore. Though writing this post did suggest to me that I ought to
try living an entire day solely using my earthquake preparedness
supplies. That would probably demonstrate some gaps.</li>
  <li>Why seek out inconvenience? The sheer number of items I would have
to test adds up to considerable effort. Do I want to pursue
even more disruption in my daily activities?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="so-i-muddle-through">So I muddle through</h2>

<p>The principles of stress-testing and resilience engineering are
powerful and worth considering but actually applying them to the
smaller-scale processes of personal life often requires more
resources, of time, money, space, or computing power, than is
justified by the benefits. I adopt such principles as seem practical
and reconsider my choices every so often. Not pursuing these
principles in every applicable case, however small, is not hypocrisy,
rather it is acknowledging that the principles apply at larger scales
than much individual activity.</p>
