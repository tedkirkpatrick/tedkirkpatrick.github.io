  <p>Defining a Kubernetes ingress seems simple enough: Define a YAML file
and you’re good. But that only defines the interface from services <em>inside</em> the
cluster to whatever external agent is connecting external client
requests to cluster services.  It says nothing about the interface
from that external agent to the Kubernetes control and data
planes. If you are building a cloud provider, how do you connect your
external load balancer to Kubernetes clusters inside your cloud?  If
you are configuring an entire on-prem cluster from scratch, how
do you set up access to the Internet?</p>

<p>Over time, the Kubernetes architects have proposed several different
approaches to connecting an external load balancer to the cluster. I
could never find documentation of the external interfaces for these
approaches.  While writing my post about
<a href="/2021/05/17/three-rings-of-kubernetes/">the three rings of Kubernetes abstractions</a>,
I saw how this connection can be made using well-known features of the
Kubernetes API.  This helped me understand how Kubernetes ingress
actually works and also explained why setting up an Ingress resource
requires installing three distinct pieces. This post records this
understanding in the hope that readers might benefit.</p>

<p>A nomenclature note: All approaches to incoming external Kubernetes
connections are denoted by the generic term “ingress”.  The specific
approach that uses an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ingress</code> resource is denoted by the proper
noun (capitalized), “Ingress”.</p>

<h2 id="ingress-via-loadbalancer-service">Ingress via LoadBalancer service</h2>

<p>The first approach to defining Kubernetes ingress was to specify a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer">type LoadBalancer Service</a>,
where an external load balancer routes traffic to the pods at the
Service Endpoints. The details of the interface between the external
load balancer and Kubernetes do not appear to be documented. The
general outline seems clear, however:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The load balancer uses the Kubernetes API to set a watch on
Services of type LoadBalancer.</li>
  <li>When the load balancer receives notice that such a service has been
created, it requests a list of all Endpoints for that service.</li>
  <li>The load balancer routes incoming traffic across the Endpoints.</li>
  <li>The load balancer continues monitoring Services and Endpoints,
modifying its internal tables as entries are added and deleted.</li>
</ol>

<p>This design provided a vendor-independent way to specify that an
external load balancer existed but configuring that load balancer
remained vendor-specific.</p>

<h2 id="ingress-via-ingress-resource-and-controller">Ingress via Ingress resource and controller</h2>

<p>The second approach was the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">Ingress</a>
resource and associated
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">Ingress controller</a>.
This approach, which <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/09/kubernetes-ingress-ga/">graduated to general availability</a> with
Kubernetes v1.19 in 2020, provides a richer language for specifying the
functions of an external load balancer in a vendor-independent
way. The cluster administrator defines rules for routing HTTP/HTTPS
requests via an Ingress resource. A vendor-specific Ingress Controller
reads this resource, converting its requests into whatever format the
vendor’s actual ingress agent requires.  For example, the Ingress
Controller for Nginx
<a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/how-it-works/">writes an Nginx configuration file</a>
and restarts the Nginx load balancer. The actual load balancer then
routes traffic to the Endpoints.</p>

<p>The Ingress resource allows vendors to define annotations specific to
their load balancer, controlling vendor-specific features. For
example, to specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an SSL
certificate to be used by an AWS load balancer, add a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#ssl-support-on-aws"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert</code> annotation</a>
to the Ingress resource.</p>

<h2 id="ingress-via-service-mesh">Ingress via service mesh</h2>

<p>In clusters with a service mesh,
the mesh often include ingress agents whose role is to bring
requests into the mesh. These agents typically interface with the
cluster using one of the two above approaches. For example, the
default
<a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/config-profiles/">Istio configuration profile</a>
defines a LoadBalanced Service implemented by one or more Envoy
proxies.</p>

<p>In terms of their external interface, service meshes are no different
from other ingress agents.  Within a mesh however, the routing of external
traffic from the agent to the Endpoints is not necessarily the
mechanisms described above for clusters without a mesh, but may
instead be routed using the mesh protocol.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Ingress, the external component that connects external clients to a
Kubernetes cluster’s services, is complex and evolving.  The
Kubernetes design team have developed two distinct approaches to
configuring such a service and are apparently considering
more. Service mesh designers have built on these to provide
approaches matched to the purpose of each mesh.</p>

<p>Understanding ingress is useful for developers to
understand the full route a client request takes from an external
address to a service inside the cluster.</p>
