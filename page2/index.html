    <p>I have many incomplete threads on distributed systems. How do I
balance my desire for complete and correct presentations with the need
to post more frequently?</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I’m writing this post to clarify my thinking about an issue in
presentation design. I’m using a stream-of-consciousness format,
with little editing. You might want to skip this one if
you are looking for careful, reasoned arguments.</em></p>

<p>This post considers the style of figures and images that complement
the ones I discussed in the
<a href="/2020/01/21/figure-failures/">figure failures</a> post. Where that post
considered figures that represent concepts geometrically, this post
considers images intended to surprise, inspire, and motivate the
audience. When should I use them? When shouldn’t I use them? Are they
of any use at all?</p>

    <p>Well-designed figures are invaluable for presenting technical detail,
including architectural diagrams, timing diagrams, data visualizations,
category hierarchies, and many other forms. Yet the simplicity and
directness of a successful figure belies the complexity of all the
design decisions underlying it. Those decisions were specific to the
original context. Pulling a figure from that context and inserting it
into a very different context such as lecture slides will likely
fail. This short post lists the many ways that such
appropriation can fail.</p>

    <p>Any given class is a story. It has a beginning, middle, and end. It
arcs toward a conclusion.  The story can be deliberate and designed or
it can be inadvertent and confused. Ultimately, the story will be
different for everyone in the room. The best that I can do as
instructor is the best any performer can do: Create an environment in
which the audience can participate, hoping that their outcomes
approximate those I had in mind. But what do I do with a prior “story”
when the class I designed for an hour and a half session last year is
scheduled this year for a sesssion of one hour?</p>

    <p>With the developing maturity of chaos engineering techniques, I see
people taking the job title, “Chaos Engineer”. Although I think chaos
engineer<em>ing</em> is a truly useful field based upon important principles,
I am wary of defining one’s job in those terms. It confuses technology
with contribution, creates a silo where we want a role. I prefer a
title like Site/Service Reliability/Resilience Engineer, which
emphasizes the bearer’s contribution to the organization. An SRE may
very well have training in chaos engineering and spend much of their
time using those methods but their role is to improve system
reliability.</p>
