<p>I recently discussed course design with some colleagues developing a
required course for a professional masters program. They wanted the course
to address a common concern for such programs: How to increase the
core CS technical skills of students in a program focused on a
specialization outside that core. Of particular concern were students
who do not have undergraduate CS degrees. Although such students bring
valuable experience from other domains, it is at the cost of lacking
the skills developed by long-term, broad study of CS. Even students
who do have such background can benefit from revisiting these
topics. How can we cover so much material in the limited time of a
single course?</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="disentangling-an-overstuffed-course">Disentangling an overstuffed course</h2>

<p>The range of possible topics for such a course is far too broad to fit
into a single semester of graduate study but that is the maximum time that
can be spared from the program.
In the interest of confidentiality, I am not going to enumerate the
detailed topic list my colleagues presented. I can say that it
included many of the topics you would expect on a list of
“essential knowledge underlying a professional Master’s in CS”.</p>

<p>Clearly, there was too much material for detailed instruction in all
topics. We began considering which ones were less important and
might be cut. For example, given five broad areas of concern, focus on
only three and not pursue the two others.</p>

<p>After some discussion, I proposed an alternative approach: Keep at
least some of the lower-priority topics but define their learning
outcomes to be <em>awareness</em> rather than <em>competence</em>.</p>

<h2 id="if-we-dont-require-competence-are-we-just-tolerating-in-competence">If we don’t require “competence” are we just tolerating “in-competence”?</h2>

<p>What do I mean by not setting some measure of “competence” as a
learning outcome? Am I just setting the tolerance low enough to accept
“incompetent” performance? I believe that rather than a lowering of
standards, my proposal adjusts the course outcomes to take
advantage of two opportunities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The co-op context of this master’s program, and</li>
  <li>Stepping outside the
limits imposed by frameworks such as the Bloom taxonomies.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m not entirely sure what I mean by these statements. This post is
my attempt to clarify them.</p>

<h3 id="building-on-the-benefits-of-co-op">Building on the benefits of co-op</h3>

<p>The program under discussion includes a required co-op semester
between the first and second years. A “co-op” semester, short for
“co-operative education semester”, is a three- or six-month salaried
internship at some organization, whether locally in Vancouver or
elsewhere in Canada or the world. This sort of semester, under various
names, is common in professional master’s programs. The semester spent
in a professional work environment is intended to meet several goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Students will practice what they have learned in their first year,
applying their skills to actual production systems.</li>
  <li>Students will learn some rather broadly-defined skills of
“professional practice”.  For this program, such practices include
project management, data governance, and other practices of
individual engineers and engineering organizations.</li>
  <li>Students will begin a professional network in the organization
and city of their internship, a network that they can build upon when
looking for work after graduation.</li>
</ol>

<p>These goals are of necessity broad, even to the point of vagueness.
The actual lessons and their effectiveness will vary widely, depending
upon the student and the specific internship. But all internships
provide an important context that is typically impossible in a
classroom: Students will work on projects that existed before
their arrival, that will continue after they leave, that are
integrated with and answerable to the larger goals of an organization,
and whose success has real consequences for that organization.</p>

<p>That organizational context seems to be an underexploited
resource. Although much of what transpires in a student’s co-op
semester is idiosyncratic and outside the educational institution’s
control, the project context itself, that students will be stepping
into a stream already in flow, is consistent. If we can determine the
parts inherent to that experience and base an educational exercise
on them, we can offload some of the learning outcomes from the core
course to the co-op semester.</p>

<p>Given that the common elements of all co-ops are organizational, with
wide variation across the technical specifics, these new learning
outcomes should focus on software engineering project practice rather
than the technical specializations of the course work. The
ongoing nature of the project context provides a learning environment
with distinct advantages over the bounded context of a single
classroom semester.</p>

<p>The program under design already uses the complementary natures of
classroom and co-op experience to provide more rounded learning
outcomes but these outcomes remain broad. How might we focus them to
offload some of the software engineering material from the proposed
core course to the co-op semester?</p>

<h2 id="defining-and-assessing-awareness-based-outcomes">Defining and assessing “awareness”-based outcomes</h2>

<p>I propose that the core course and the co-op semester be coordinated
to achieve some combined learning outcomes in software engineering and
project management. The core course would prepare the students to be
alert to or aware of selected issues. They would then watch for and
observe these issues as they arise within the context of their co-op
projects. At the conclusion of their co-op, they would write a
structured report, consolidating their observations into insights for
future practice.</p>

<p>This design requires that the outcomes for each topic be written in
complementary pairs. The outcomes for the core course would prepare
the students to critically observe, while the outcomes for the co-op
report would specify the ultimate learning goals for the topic.</p>

<p>Although the co-op outcomes could be written using whatever conventions
the design team preferred, such as Bloom’s taxonomy, the
outcomes for the core course seem different, ill-matched to Bloom.
We are not specifying a degree of understanding so much as a degree
of <em>preparedness to observe</em>.  What form might such outcomes take?</p>

<h3 id="working-backwards-from-the-ultimate-outcomes">Working backwards from the ultimate outcomes</h3>

<p>The learning outcomes for the co-op semester would set the goals for
the entire sequence. The sequence comprises these distinct activities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Core course: Do some brief, topic-specific preparation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Co-op semester: Observe the context of the projects to which they
contribute.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Followup (either at end of co-op or start of following semester):
Reflect on their observations, according to a specified structure.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Given the structured reflection to be performed in Step 3, what
kind of observations in the co-op semester (Step 2) will provide students the
best material? And to prepare for those observations, what activities
do students need to perform in the core course (Step 1)?</p>

<p>For the co-op experience to provide material for deeper insights,
students should first be prepared to actively observe the practices of
their organization. Such observation must prepare them to notice
missing components as well as those that are present.</p>

<p>Observation is most effective when active, not passive. Students will
benefit from periodically recording their observations, setting up new
rounds of questions. On the other hand, given that the primary purpose
of the co-op is to deliver value to their employer there are
constraints on what we might expect students to do. Their observations
should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Not disrupt their assigned projects.</li>
  <li>Not violate confidentiality requirements.</li>
  <li>Not intrude on activities of other team members.</li>
</ol>

<p>In light of these constraints, individual reflection seems the best
approach. Students might fill out periodic checklists or
questionnaires or keep a structured diary. The biggest challenge is
ensuring some form of oversight so that students do the activities at
their scheduled time, rather than deferring them until the end of their co-op.</p>

<h2 id="example-data-governance-framework">Example: Data governance framework</h2>

<p><a href="https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data-governance">Data governance</a>
is a topic that is both important to cover and difficult to teach
within the constraints of a classroom, where lessons can readily devolve to
recitation of categories and best practices. Although an instructor
can attempt to provide more direct engagement with the material by
asking the students to analyze case studies, such exercises suffer
from the necessity of presenting the entire context in written form
and lack the urgency of actual stakes.</p>

<p>By contrast, the co-op semester provides an environment that directly
complements these restrictions because its context is tacit, requiring the
learner to draw it out, and its projects have substantive
consequences.</p>

<p>Pointing out these differences is nothing new; they form the heart
of longstanding rationales for internships. In this post I am simply
considering what specific style of learning outcomes in the preceding
course will focus the learner’s observations in the co-op semester.</p>

<h3 id="data-governance-components">Data governance components</h3>

<p>TechTarget’s <a href="https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data-governance">definition
of a data governance framework</a> includes several components:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A data governance framework consists of the rules, processes,
organizational structures and technologies that are put into place
as part of a governance program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The co-op semester provides an opportunity for the learner to practice
identifying these in an actual organization. This identification is
subtle, as some components may be named differently from the names
used in the literature or they may be partial or altogether absent. If
a student were asked to locate these components in the organization in
which they worked their co-op semester, the student might just submit
a rote list of boxes in the organizational chart and policies in the
manual. The student would miss the deeper issues, such as how policies
are enforced and extended or what technological checks enforce the
policies.</p>

<h3 id="co-op-activities-to-learn-data-governance">Co-op activities to learn data governance</h3>

<p>A simple approach to learning the components of data governance is
least likely to disrupt a student’s co-op schedule.  We might group
the learning into three phases, with one activity in each phase:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Early co-op: Checklist or category list, identifying the components
of the data governance program at the employing organization. The
student identifies the <em>de jure</em> structure.</li>
  <li>Middle co-op: Short answers to questions about how the components
work in practice.  The student identifies the <em>de facto</em> structure.</li>
  <li>Post co-op: Group discussion, moderated by an instructor, amongst
students after they have returned to campus.  The student
synthesizes the two above, identifying the <em>whole</em> structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="derived-outcomes-for-the-core-course">Derived outcomes for the core course</h2>

<p>The activities students will perform during their co-op semester in
turn drive the outcomes for the core course that precedes it. To
prepare for co-op activities such as those suggested above, the core
course outcomes would be straighforward capacities to define and
recognize the components.</p>

<p>The actual time spent on data governance in the core course would
therefore be small, such as readings of basic governance structure and
a few activities practicing with the checklists and questionnaires
that they will use in the co-op.</p>

<p>Do these outcomes fit well within the Bloom taxonomy?  On the one
hand, the taxonomy is broad enough that anything can be pressed into
its structure. On the other hand, these outcomes have a distinct quality
resulting from the process that produced them. Rather than defining
outcomes in terms of actions students might take in their ultimate
career, we defined them in terms of the <em>learning activities</em>
students would perform in the next course. The core course merely
prepares the students for the actual learning that will occur in the
co-op.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Process-oriented topics such as professional practice are ill-matched
to classroom courses. They can consume undue time for too little
benefit. Programs that require a co-op or internship experience might
have better results while consuming less class time by adding
structured activities to the co-op instead of the classroom. The
students would prepare for these activities in a core course before
they begin co-op and reflect on their experience in another course upon
their return. The key point is to define multi-step learning
outcomes, with the actual outcomes defined for the co-op, while the
core course defines outcomes in terms of preparation to learn.</p>

<p>There are administrative issues that I have not addressed here. The
co-op semesters already have some activities defined by the co-op
department. Adding new activities must be done in cooperation with
that department. The proposed activities further require that someone
review student assignments to ensure timely submission and sincere
attempts. Finally, scheduling a joint return discussion may be
difficult if the students do not all have a common required course upon
return.</p>

<p>These administrative issues will need careful consideration and
resolving them may require modifying the proposed structure. Those
efforts seem warranted however, as the alternative appproach of
stuffing everything into a single core course is certain to be less
effective.</p>
