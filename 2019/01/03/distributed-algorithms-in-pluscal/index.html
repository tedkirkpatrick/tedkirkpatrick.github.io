  <p><em>Second in a series on using the TLA Toolbox to explore the failure
 tolerance of distributed algorithms. The first post
 <a href="/2018/10/31/exploring-distributed-algorithm-failures-using-tla-toolbox/">presented the context and why the topic is important</a>. The
 next post describes the <a href="/2019/01/18/fairness-semantics-of-pluscal/">semantics of fairness in PlusCal</a></em>.</p>

<p>Before describing how to analyze failures in distributed algorithms in
the TLA Toolbox, I want to provide some backround in the conventions I
use to represent the algorithms. Although Lamport has provided a
<a href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/pluscal.html">good reference for the features of the PlusCal language</a>,
there is a lack of material on how to structure the larger scale
of algorithms. As my purpose in this series is to provide an
intermediate level tutorial, in this post I want to describe the
conventions I use to make writing distributed algorithms in PlusCal
more readable and reliable, while the next post will clarify some
potentially obscure aspects of PlusCal semantics.  With that
background out of the way, I can turn to the main topic.</p>

<h2 id="the-dialect">The dialect</h2>

<p>PlusCal has two dialects, PlusCal-c, which uses syntax similar to C
(but different enough in the details to be confusing),
and PlusCal-p, which uses syntax similar to Pascal. I prefer the
PlusCal-p syntax, as it emphasizes that I am presenting an algorithm
rather than a bowdlerized C program.</p>

<h2 id="the-common-structure-of-many-distributed-algorithms">The common structure of many distributed algorithms</h2>

<p>Effective PlusCal is a matter of matching the features of the language
to the structure of the algorithms that we want to represent.  Many
distributed algorithms have a common structure, an infinite loop whose
body is a collection of alternatives, each guarded by a condition:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>while TRUE do
  either
    guard1
      alternative1
  or
    guard2
      alternative2
  or
    ...
  end either
end while
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each guard specifies the enabling condition for its associated
alternative.  In each loop iteration, one of the enabled alternatives
is chosen to be executed. So long as at least one guard is true,
enabling its alternative, the loop continues to execute.  The loop may
also terminate if it executes an alternative that ends with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goto</code>
out of the loop.</p>

<p>If there is an iteration in which every alternative is disabled, the
algorithm has deadlocked. When checking the algorithm with TLC, you
can set an option for TLC to check for deadlocks.</p>

<p>What is the best way to represent this structure in PlusCal?</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-actions-and-atomicity">Alternatives, actions, and atomicity</h2>

<p>In the above structure, an “alternative” may comprise one or more
actions. In TLA, <em>action</em> denotes a single transition in the
underlying state machine.  In PlusCal code, this would be all the
statements lying between a guard and the first label following it.  So
long as the alternative enabled by a guard has no labels, it comprises
a single TLA action. If the alternative includes labels, then it
comprises one more TLA action than the number of labels it contains.</p>

<p>The granularity of an alternative determines its atomicity. If it is
only a single TLA action, it is <em>atomic</em>: It executes instantaneously,
while all other processes are paused. An alternative that includes one
or more labels, on the other hand, will have its execution
interspersed with actions by other processes. I will return to this
point in a moment; for now, I’ll simply state that for distributed
algorithms, which only communicate through messages, atomicity of
alternatives in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">either</code> statement is less important than for
algorithms that communicate through shared memory.</p>

<h2 id="guards-in-pluscal">Guards in PlusCal</h2>

<p>PlusCal guards can have rich structure. They are constructed from
three language keywords that define an enabling condition: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when</code> keywords are
interchangeable. In the Lamport algorithm, I chose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when</code> because it
gave the algorithm a straightforward reading but for other algorithms
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> might read better.</p>

<p>Whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when</code> simply establish an enabling condition, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> keyword combines an enabling condition with the operation of
choosing a value from a set. An expression such as</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>with a \in { ... some set ...}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>is enabled when the set is nonempty. Furthermore, when the set is
nonempty, a value is nondeterministically chosen and assigned to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>.</p>

<p>A guard composed of just one of these keywords is simple enough to
interpret. For example, in the following snippet,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>when /\ 1 &lt; b
     /\ b &lt; 10;
  \* guarded alternative ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>the alternative is enabled when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> is strictly between 1 and 10.</p>

<p>However, PlusCal allows combining enabling statements and even
interspersing assignments with guards. Guards can be placed at any
point in an action, even as the last statement. The evaluation rule
for actions is:</p>

<p class="pull">An action is enabled if and only if every one of its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> statements is enabled. If even one guard is
disabled, no statement in the action is executed.</p>

<p>This rule implies that the evaluation may backtrack when a guard
depends upon the result of an assignment. Consider this snippet:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a := b + 1;
await a &gt; 2;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b &lt;= 1</code>, the action will not be enabled and so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> will not in fact
be assigned in the preceding statement.  The action comprising these
two statements is only executed if the assignment <em>were to have
resulted</em> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a &gt; 2</code>.</p>

<p>Another way of viewing this is that the mathematical equalities
in the TLA underlying PlusCal allow us to rewrite the above
statements as the equivalent</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>await b &gt; 1;
a := b + 1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>moving the guard before the assignment.</p>

<h2 id="atomic-actions-and-data-races-in-distributed-algorithms">Atomic actions and data races in distributed algorithms</h2>

<p>The second requirement for effective use of PlusCal is knowing when
and how to ensure atomic actions.  This is directly related to the
distinction between local and global variables.</p>

<p>In a completely distributed algorithm, processes only communicate via
messages. Writing such an algorithm in PlusCal, the system state is
split, such that</p>

<ul>
  <li>the state of the <em>algorithm</em> is contained in the local variables of its
processes, and</li>
  <li>the state of the <em>network</em>, the messages in transit, is contained in
the global variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because process variables are local, you can freely mix references and
assignments to them, without concern for intervening actions by other
processes, whereas for global variables, mixing references and
assignments may introduce race conditions.  The syntactic distinction
between local and global variables highlights the ones for which
atomic access is important:</p>

<p class="pull">When writing a message-passing algorithm in PlusCal, the only
variables for which atomic access matters are the global variables
representing the network.</p>

<h3 id="example-contrasting-local-and-global-variables">Example contrasting local and global variables</h3>

<p>For example, consider the following algorithm, which includes one
global variable and two local variables:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>--algorithm RaceAlgo
variables
  \* Global variable
  glob

process Proc \in 1 .. 2
variables
  \* Variables local to process
  loc1 \in 1 .. 2,
  loc2

begin
(* Unaffected by other processes because loc1, loc2 are local ... *)
L1:
  loc2 := loc1 + 1;
L2:
  loc2 := loc2 + 1;

(* ... but following has race condition because glob is global *)
L3:
  glob := loc1 + 1;
L4:
  glob := glob + 1;

  print &lt;&lt;self, loc1, loc2, glob&gt;&gt;

end process
end algorithm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this on TLC, it finds 54 distinct end states. The algorithm is
symmetric, so there are 6 distinct outcomes, repeated for each
process:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loc1</code></th>
      <th style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loc2</code></th>
      <th style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glob</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>3</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>3</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>2</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>4</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>4</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In every case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loc2</code> equals <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loc1 + 2</code>, but not necessarily for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glob</code>, which can have three different outcomes for each value
of<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loc1</code>. We get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glob</code> equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loc1 + 2</code> if the two processes are
executed sequentially, producing the two highlighted rows: 1, 3, 3 and
2, 4, 4.  But those aren’t the only outcomes. In addition to them,
there are four other outcomes for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glob</code>, from executions that
intermingled execution of the statements at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L3</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L4</code> by
Processes 1 and 2.</p>

<p>As the example demonstrates, we can assign to local variables without
concern for the presence of labels but when assigning to global
variables we must be alert to the placement of labels, as those mark
points where a different process could intervene and update the globals.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-network-operations-as-macros">Packaging network operations as macros</h2>

<p>Given that global variables represent the network state and are also
the variables for which we need to ensure atomic access, it would be
useful to have a way to ensure our network operations are atomic.
PlusCal macros fulfill this need because they are always atomic, not
allowed to include a label. Macros also package the slightly unfamiliar
representation of networks as sets and functions into familiar
operation names.</p>

<p>For example, in the Lamport algorithm, the network is represented as a
function of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Channel</code>, a mapping from source and
destination process ids to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sequence</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Messages</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Channel == [src \in Pid |-&gt; [dst \in Pid |-&gt; Seq(Message)]]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The network itself is a variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">channel</code> of that type, and a
network broadcast is represented by</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>channel := [channel EXCEPT ![self] =
             [dst \in Pid |-&gt;
               IF dst = self THEN channel[self][self]
                             ELSE Append(channel[self][dst], msg)]]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is more readably written as the macro call</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Broadcast(msg);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a more complex example, consider receiving a message. The
receiving process must perform three steps in sequence:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wait for a message of a specified <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> to be
available at the head of the sequence sent from at least one source,</li>
  <li>pick the process id of one source when the wait is satisfied, and</li>
  <li>remove that message from the sequence, passing the message contents
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">time</code> to the destination.</li>
</ol>

<p>The resulting code is subtle:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>with s \in {src \in Pid: /\ Len(channel[src][dst]) &gt; 0
                         /\ Head(channel[src][dst]).type = type
           } do
  src := s;
  time := Head(channel[src][self]).time;
  channel := [channel EXCEPT ![src][self] = Tail(channel[src][self])]
end with
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s far more readable when packaged into a macro call:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Receive("AckReq", src, time);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Receive</code> macro functions as both a guard and, when the guard is
enabled and allows the assignments to be executed, updates the global
state. A message is removed from the network (represented by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">channel</code>) and its contents, a sender id and logical clock value, are
assigned to local variables. In the actual algorithm, its call looks like</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>either
 ...
or
  Receive("AckReq", src, time); \* Guard; updates src and time
    clock := Max(clock, time);  \* Update local clock
    acks := acks \union {src}   \* Record receipt of acknowledgement
or
 ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I indent the statements following the guard to indicate that their
execution is controlled by the guard.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Effective use of PlusCal for distributed algorithms requires matching
the language features to the structure of the algorithm. Typically,
the only actions that have to be atomic are those that reference or
update global variables. Package global accesses as macros, ensuring
atomic access. Given that these actions are nearly always network
operations, the macros also make the operations clearer than the
underlying TLA expressions.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the guards enabling the alternative choices in an
algorithm.  Often these guards will be macros representing network
operations that wait on a message of a specific type and retrieve the
message contents when one is received.</p>

<p>I have found that adopting these conventions makes my algorithms
clearer and more reliable.  In the next post, I’ll go beneath this
syntax and explore a subtle point of the semantics of PlusCal.</p>
