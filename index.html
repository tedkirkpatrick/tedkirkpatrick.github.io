    <p><em>Note: Over the past eight months, I have been working with the code for
TenCent’s <a href="https://github.com/Tencent/phxpaxos">Phxpaxos</a>, an
open-source implementation of replicated state-machines, with
consensus enforced by Paxos. I have learned a lot from studying this
code and from comparing it with the more focussed
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/sciascid/libpaxos/src/master/">libpaxos</a>, which
does not include state machine code.</em></p>

<p><em>Recently I have isolated several topics well-adapted to the smaller size
of blog posts and I will be adding them here.</em></p>

<p>Distributed systems are often made highly available by implementing
them as replicated state machines, coordinating their operations via a
consensus algorithm such as Paxos. Two popular tutorials from the
1990s describe the basic theory but how hard is it to implement this
theory?  The code from the
<a href="https://github.com/Tencent/phxpaxos">Phxpaxos</a> project suggests that
the general solution requires more work than it might seem.</p>

    <p>When I teach a course in modern distributed systems design, I spend a
lot of time on topics such as engineering for resilience and
automating production processes. It turns out that applying those big
topics in the small matters of my life is a big challenge.</p>

    <p>The phrase “distributed systems” has had several meanings over the
last 50 years, from a mathematical topic to a style of
engineering practice to a suite of technologies. What can
we learn from these changes and how do we reconcile these
perspectives?</p>

    <p>I have many incomplete threads on distributed systems. How do I
balance my desire for complete and correct presentations with the need
to post more frequently?</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I’m writing this post to clarify my thinking about an issue in
presentation design. I’m using a stream-of-consciousness format,
with little editing. You might want to skip this one if
you are looking for careful, reasoned arguments.</em></p>

<p>This post considers the style of figures and images that complement
the ones I discussed in the
<a href="/2020/01/21/figure-failures/">figure failures</a> post. Where that post
considered figures that represent concepts geometrically, this post
considers images intended to surprise, inspire, and motivate the
audience. When should I use them? When shouldn’t I use them? Are they
of any use at all?</p>
