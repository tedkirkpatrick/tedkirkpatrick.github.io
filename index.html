    <p>In their classic article,
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub40801/">“The Tail at Scale”</a>, Dean
and Barroso formulate an important principle of service design: Reduce
the variance of the latency for low-level services because that has a
large impact on the performance of their callers.  This effect arises
due to the high number of subservices called by a typical main
service, making it likely that at least one subservice will have an
extremely slow response, holding back the main service. In their article, Dean and
Barroso focus on the very largest latencies but extending their
argument to smaller but more frequent latencies provides even more insight into service
design.</p>

        Guarantees vs. metrics: What the designers intend, what the clients see

    <p>In my
<a href="/2019/12/31/design-space-2020/">distributed systems design space</a>, I
distinguish guarantees from metrics. A <em>guarantee</em> is a property a
system is designed to ensure in all cases, such as consistency between
replicas of a data store, or the number of copies written to
persistent storage before a result is returned to the client. In
contrast, a <em>metric</em> is a measurable quantity of a system, such as
median latency or annual availability. The guarantee/metric
distinction arises from the designer’s perspective and clearly
separates the two categories. But when we consider the categories
instead from the perspective of the system’s clients, this distinction
becomes fuzzier. Is it real? Is it valuable?</p>

    <p>How do students assess the value of what they learn in class? On the
one hand, years of attending school have made them sophisticated
judges of teaching effectiveness: They know whether an approach is
working for their circumstances and purposes—although these
may diverge far from the instructor’s goals. At the same time, students
can harbour a curious enthusiasm for a course precisely because it
overhwelms them.  Why do they respond this way?</p>

    <p><em>Note: Over the past eight months, I have been working with the code for
TenCent’s <a href="https://github.com/Tencent/phxpaxos">Phxpaxos</a>, an
open-source implementation of replicated state-machines, with
consensus enforced by Paxos. I have learned a lot from studying this
code and from comparing it with the more focussed
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/sciascid/libpaxos/src/master/">libpaxos</a>, which
does not include state machine code.</em></p>

<p><em>Recently I have isolated several topics well-adapted to the smaller size
of blog posts and I will be adding them here.</em></p>

<p>Distributed systems are often made highly available by implementing
them as replicated state machines, coordinating their operations via a
consensus algorithm such as Paxos. Two popular tutorials from the
1990s describe the basic theory but how hard is it to implement this
theory?  The code from the
<a href="https://github.com/Tencent/phxpaxos">Phxpaxos</a> project suggests that
the general solution requires more work than it might seem.</p>

    <p>When I teach a course in modern distributed systems design, I spend a
lot of time on topics such as engineering for resilience and
automating production processes. It turns out that applying those big
topics in the small matters of my life is a big challenge.</p>
