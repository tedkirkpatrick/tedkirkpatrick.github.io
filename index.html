    <p>Defining a Kubernetes ingress seems simple enough: Define a YAML file
and you’re good. But that only defines the interface from services <em>inside</em> the
cluster to whatever external agent is connecting external client
requests to cluster services.  It says nothing about the interface
from that external agent to the Kubernetes control and data
planes. If you are building a cloud provider, how do you connect your
external load balancer to Kubernetes clusters inside your cloud?  If
you are configuring an entire on-prem cluster from scratch, how
do you set up access to the Internet?</p>

    <p>A common analogy for Kubernetes presents it as “the operating system
for microservices”, identifying Kubernetes
as a kind of operating system. I don’t think this analogy is wrong but
I do think it’s underinformative, leaving the key question unanswered:
What <em>abstractions</em> does this “operating system” provide?  I suggest
that unlike the more focused set of abstractions provided by the
classic Unix model, the abstractions of Kubernetes can be grouped into
three concentric rings. This highlights the different
kinds of benefits Kubernetes affords and clarifies the decisions an
organization must make when adopting Kubernetes.</p>

    <p>Mentoring. Everyone thinks it’s a great idea and many claim to do it.
Yet both formal studies and my personal observations suggest that such
relationships are rarely sustained and often not retrospectively
valued by the junior participants. To sustain effective mentoring many
elements must be in place but I believe that an essential requirement
is this: <em>The mentor cannot have authority over their protege</em>.  The
mentor’s suggestions must be suggestions, not orders. Without that
basis, the whole relationship falters. Teaching and supervising are
distinct roles from mentoring, however much they share elements with
it.  The advisory nature of mentoring affects every aspect of the
relationship.</p>

        The basics of latency percentiles

    <p>Designers of distributed systems obsess over service latency. They
forecast latencies of proposed designs, stress-test the latencies of
systems under development, equalize latencies of
replicated services by load balancing, monitor latencies of production
systems using instrumentation, and commit to latency targets in
service level objectives and agreements.</p>

<p>The most commonly-used representation of latency in these scenarios is
<a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/why-averages-suck-and-percentiles-are-great/">percentiles</a>. Percentiles
are deceptively simple, a function from values between 0 and 1 (or
equivalently 0% and 100%) to a response time. But the relation between
percentiles and the distribution they describe is subtle: Formally,
the percentile function is the inverse of the integral of the
probability density of the distribution.</p>

<p>The subtlety of this construction makes
it easy to miss a step and become confused. Working through the
basics in detail, gaining a clear understanding of how percentiles relate to
other representations of latency, provides designers with a straightforward
approach to reasoning about a fundamental concept in distributed
systems design.</p>

    <p><em>A companion post goes into more detail on
  <a href="/2020/09/09/latency-basics.html">constructing the percentile function from a density function</a>.</em></p>

<p>In their classic article,
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub40801/">“The Tail at Scale”</a>, Dean
and Barroso formulate an important principle of service design: Reduce
the variance of the latency for low-level services because that has a
large impact on the performance of their callers.  This effect arises
due to the high number of subservices called by a typical main
service, making it likely that at least one subservice will have an
extremely slow response, holding back the main service. In their article, Dean and
Barroso focus on the very largest latencies but extending their
argument to smaller but more frequent latencies provides even more insight into service
design.</p>
