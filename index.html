    <p>Mentoring. Everyone thinks it’s a great idea and many claim to do it.
Yet both formal studies and my personal observations suggest that such
relationships are rarely sustained and often not retrospectively
valued by the junior participants. To sustain effective mentoring many
elements must be in place but I believe that an essential requirement
is this: <em>The mentor cannot have authority over their protege</em>.  The
mentor’s suggestions must be suggestions, not orders. Without that
basis, the whole relationship falters. Teaching and supervising are
distinct roles from mentoring, however much they share elements with
it.  The advisory nature of mentoring affects every aspect of the
relationship.</p>

        The basics of latency percentiles

    <p>Designers of distributed systems obsess over service latency. They
forecast latencies of proposed designs, stress-test the latencies of
systems under development, equalize latencies of
replicated services by load balancing, monitor latencies of production
systems using instrumentation, and commit to latency targets in
service level objectives and agreements.</p>

<p>The most commonly-used representation of latency in these scenarios is
<a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/why-averages-suck-and-percentiles-are-great/">percentiles</a>. Percentiles
are deceptively simple, a function from values between 0 and 1 (or
equivalently 0% and 100%) to a response time. But the relation between
percentiles and the distribution they describe is subtle: Formally,
the percentile function is the inverse of the integral of the
probability density of the distribution.</p>

<p>The subtlety of this construction makes
it easy to miss a step and become confused. Working through the
basics in detail, gaining a clear understanding of how percentiles relate to
other representations of latency, provides designers with a straightforward
approach to reasoning about a fundamental concept in distributed
systems design.</p>

    <p><em>A companion post goes into more detail on
  <a href="/2020/09/09/latency-basics.html">constructing the percentile function from a density function</a>.</em></p>

<p>In their classic article,
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub40801/">“The Tail at Scale”</a>, Dean
and Barroso formulate an important principle of service design: Reduce
the variance of the latency for low-level services because that has a
large impact on the performance of their callers.  This effect arises
due to the high number of subservices called by a typical main
service, making it likely that at least one subservice will have an
extremely slow response, holding back the main service. In their article, Dean and
Barroso focus on the very largest latencies but extending their
argument to smaller but more frequent latencies provides even more insight into service
design.</p>

        Guarantees vs. metrics: What the designers intend, what the clients see

    <p>In my
<a href="/2019/12/31/design-space-2020/">distributed systems design space</a>, I
distinguish guarantees from metrics. A <em>guarantee</em> is a property a
system is designed to ensure in all cases, such as consistency between
replicas of a data store, or the number of copies written to
persistent storage before a result is returned to the client. In
contrast, a <em>metric</em> is a measurable quantity of a system, such as
median latency or annual availability. The guarantee/metric
distinction arises from the designer’s perspective and clearly
separates the two categories. But when we consider the categories
instead from the perspective of the system’s clients, this distinction
becomes fuzzier. Is it real? Is it valuable?</p>

    <p>How do students assess the value of what they learn in class? On the
one hand, years of attending school have made them sophisticated
judges of teaching effectiveness: They know whether an approach is
working for their circumstances and purposes—although these
may diverge far from the instructor’s goals. At the same time, students
can harbour a curious enthusiasm for a course precisely because it
overhwelms them.  Why do they respond this way?</p>
