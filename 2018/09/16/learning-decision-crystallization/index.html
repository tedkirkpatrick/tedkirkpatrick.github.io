  <p><em>Fifth in a series on group decision-making, based on Ch. 10–11 of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Meetings-Work-Achieving-Decisions/dp/0761927050/">Making Meetings Work</a>. The previous post
showed <a href="/2018/09/05/discussion-rounds-and-decision-crystallization/">how to crystallize a decision out of a round of discussion</a>.</em></p>

<p>The last two posts, on
<a href="/2018/08/29/the-decision-mosaic-every-piece-in-place/">focusing the group</a>
towards the most important next decision element and on
<a href="/2018/09/05/discussion-rounds-and-decision-crystallization/">how to crystallize a decision</a>
out of the ensuing discussion, highlight how subtle the process of
group decision-making is. And it all has to be done in real time,
potentially while the group is making decisions with real impact on
your work and life. It’s not an obvious process, not something that
you just fall into. How do you learn this skill?</p>

<p>You can find opportunities to practice decision crystallization in
both actual meetings, convened to commit to actual decisions, and in
mock meetings, convened solely to practice the skill of crystallization.</p>

<h2 id="practicing-in-actual-meetings">Practicing in actual meetings</h2>

<p>Actual meetings, with real decisions on the line, are the most
effective places to learn the process of decision
crystallization. Participants will be engaged because the outcomes of
these meetings will have real impact in their lives.</p>

<h3 id="observing">Observing</h3>

<p>For the same reasons, however, you want increase your own engagement
in such meetings gradually. It might help to begin by simply observing
meetings in which you have no responsibility. As an auditor, you can
observe the dynamics of group decision-making with the dispassionate
eye of someone unaffected by the choices made. If you do this, bear in
mind that you are there only to listen, not to contribute. You’ll have
opportunity to practice vocalizing the crystallization step later,
after these listening sessions.</p>

<p>When observing, watch for discussion rounds, noting their shape and
how pauses indicate the round’s end. Is there a clear decision element
under discussion and does it seem an appropriate choice at this point?
Note what happens at round’s end: Does someone suggest a choice, does
someone simply express frustration with the apparent lack of progress,
does someone start a new round, or something else? If a member makes a
proposal, do they support it with one or more decision rule?  How does
the group respond?</p>

<h3 id="crystallizing">Crystallizing</h3>

<p>Once your ear is attuned to the shape of discussion rounds, you can
practice as an actual participant.  Note that any participant can
initiate crystallization—the role is not restricted to the
chair. When you hear the end of a round, propose a choice using the
crystallization sequence: neutral summary, action hypothesis, and
legitimization. The response of the group, whether “go” or “no go”,
will typically be clear to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="gradually-increasing-your-responsibility">Gradually increasing your responsibility</h3>

<p>Although any member, not just the chair, can initiate crystallization,
groups are also sensitive to someone dominating. They will accept the
chair guiding every round—setting the determinative element,
crystallizing the choice, and refocusing—but will not accept the
same from a member not assigned that role, especially if the member is
considered junior in the organization. Furthermore, although
this method works well and seems “natural” when done well, it also
takes some time for groups to become comfortable with the process.
For all these reasons, when beginning to practice this skill, if you
are not the designated chair, only try to crystallize the discussion
once or twice in any one meeting.  With practice, and greater
familiarity in the group, you can guide discussion more often. You may
well see other members picking up on the basic idea and trying it
themselves, once they’ve seen it in action.</p>

<h2 id="practicing-in-mock-meetings">Practicing in mock meetings</h2>

<p>It can take quite a while to learn this skill if you only exercise it
once or twice a meeting. You can accelerate the process by
role-playing or practicing with some like-minded coworkers or friends
and family. There’s many ways of doing this, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When a group is making a simple, daily decision through informal
means, such as where to go for lunch, try instead doing it using a
decision array, with you selecting the determinative element,
observing the rounds, and crystallizing at the end of the round.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only do this with a group who have all previously
expressed interest in improving their own meeting skills. Otherwise,
asking hungry, busy coworkers to delay lunch while you indulge in
your hobby is a good way to isolate your self at work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a friend list a lot of pros and cons for a decision, whether
real or fabricated.  Try suggesting a choice using the four
parts of decision crystallization and then have your friend respond to
your proposal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Role-play a meeting from a fictional world you all know, such as the
King’s Council from Game of Thrones or the bridge of the Starship
Enterprise. How should Cersei respond to the High Sparrow or Picard
to the Borg? Take turns focusing the discussion on the next element
and crystallizing the choices.  Can your team come to a better
decision than your fictional counterparts?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="returning-to-the-whole-decision">Returning to the whole decision</h2>

<p>Eventually, all elements in the array will have been decided. The
group will have an enthusiastic energy from this positive progress.
The decision process is almost complete. The next post will describe
the final step,
<a href="/2018/09/21/decision-sculpting/">arranging these elements into the final mosaic</a>.</p>
