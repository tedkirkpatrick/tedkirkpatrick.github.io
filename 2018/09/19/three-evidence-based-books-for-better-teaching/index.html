  <p>I’ve read many books on effective university education, covering a
range of topics and perspectives.  An annotated bibliography of them
all would be a <em>long</em> post.</p>

<p>At any given time, however, there’s a small subset of those books that
directly drive my decisions.  Here are three books that I refer to
routinely in my current course designs.</p>

<p>All three take an evidence-based approach, grounding their claims of
effectiveness in reliably-determined research results.  From this
broad starting point, they travel to distinct destinations, at very
different levels: the big issues of teaching (practice, motivation,
assessment, …), specific activities you can ask your students to
perform, and myths that have entered into received wisdom.</p>

<p>I am intimidated by the effort it must have required to prepare each
of these books.  The authors had to read and synthesize the results
from hundreds of papers, discarding those with questionable research
designs or low experimental power.  Then they had to derive their
synthesis at a more abstract level, isolating broader principles that
might be applied in a range of teaching contexts.  This is a
tremendous service, as few instructors will have the time to read even
a fraction of the requisite articles.</p>

<p>These very different books complement each other well. Read them,
apply their ideas, and your own teaching will surely improve.  They
demonstrate the value of an evidence-based approach to the teaching
literature.  Let’s have more like these.</p>

<p>The first two recommendations are courtesy of
<a href="http://third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a>, whose writings and conversations
have had a tremendous impact on my teaching.</p>

<h2 id="informed-principles-your-overall-course-design">Informed Principles: Your Overall Course Design</h2>

<p>This first book is the single best starting starting point for
course and curriculum design.
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/How+Learning+Works%3A+Seven+Research+Based+Principles+for+Smart+Teaching-p-9780470484104">How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching</a>
is organized around seven “research-based principles”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Students’ prior knowledge can help or hinder their learning.</li>
  <li>The way students organize knowledge influences how they learn and
apply what they know.</li>
  <li>Students’ motivation generates, directs, and sustains what they do
to learn.</li>
  <li>To develop mastery, students must acquire component skils, practice
integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.</li>
  <li><em>Goal-directed</em> practice coupled with <em>targeted</em> feedback are
critical to learning.</li>
  <li>Students’ current level of development interacts with the social,
emotional, and intellectucal climate of the course to impact learning.</li>
  <li>To become self-directed learners, students must learn to assess the
demands of the task, evaluate their own knowledge and skills, plan
their approach, monitor their progress, and adjust their strategies
as needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>As ever, the details are what really matters and the authors deliver
those in abundance, identifying the elements instructors have to
have in place to successfully support these principles and create the
most effective learning environment for their students. All claims are
supported by references to reliably-supported research results.</p>

<p>With its focus on broad principles arching over all of education,
regardless of level and domain, this book provides a modern,
evidence-grounded framework for thinking about any course.</p>

<p>This is the sort of book that one has to read multiple times, with
intervening gaps of practice, to derive most benefit. Writing this
summary has reminded me it’s time for a reread.</p>

<h2 id="informed-activities-things-your-learners-can-do">Informed Activities: Things Your Learners Can Do</h2>

<p>Where “How Learning Works” explored the big picture of course design,
<a href="https://www.routledge.com/Teaching-for-Learning-101-Intentionally-Designed-Educational-Activities/Howell-Major-Harris-Zakrajsek/p/book/9780415699365">Teaching for Learning: 101 Intentionally Designed Educational Activities to Put Students on the Path to Success</a>
takes a bottom-up approach, introducing 101 activities whose
effectiveness is supported by empirical results. The book organizes
these activities into eight chapters, with titles such as “Discussion”
or “Writing to Learn”.</p>

<p>Each chapter begins with an overview of the activity type, 
distinguishing this type of activity
from others with similar names but distinct structures. The authors
summarize the broad empirical results regarding this type.
They next categorize the several forms this type of activity might take, such
as whole-class discussion versus dividing the class into discussion
dyads.
They conclude the overview with evidence-based recommendations for how
to organize these activities for most effective learning outcomes.</p>

<p>Following the overview, the authors provide detailed descriptions of
all the activities of this type.  They call these activities IDEAs, an
acronym for	Intentionally Designed Educational Activities.  For each
IDEA, they describe its structure, its likely learning benefits, and
the research supporting its use.</p>

<p>This isn’t the sort of book I’d read cover to cover.  The long lists
of IDEAs can be numbing.  However, the chapter introductions are a
tremendous resource in their own right. The introductions provide a
fantastic overview of the essential types of class activity,
highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each. I find the
recommendations on effective implementation of each activity
particularly useful.  Taken together, the introductions orient each
activity in light of all the others.  I finished the book with a sense of how
these disparate pieces fit.</p>

<p>I also gained from some of the authors’ careful distinctions between
similar-sounding activities that in fact have quite different
outcomes. For example, the authors categorize “Socratic dialogue”
under “Lecturing” rather than
“Discussion groups” because classic Socratic technique has a specific,
planned sequence of points, as opposed to the freer topic choices
characterizing discussion.  Whether or not you agree with such
characterizations, simply considering them will clarify your own practice.</p>

<h2 id="informed-skepticism-contesting-unsupported-myths">Informed Skepticism: Contesting Unsupported Myths</h2>

<p>Where the first two books describe approaches to teaching and learning
that are well-supported by evidence,
<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/urban-myths-about-learning-and-education/de-bruyckere/978-0-12-801537-7">Urban Myths About Learning and Education</a>
focuses instead on those widely-assumed assumptions that have
in fact been contradicted or unsupported by evidence.  Where the first
two books make you a more successful teacher, this short book makes you a
more successful skeptic, fending off the mountebanks and sellers of
educational snake oil.</p>

<p>Their introductory chapter sets the agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have become saddled with a multiplicity of methods, approaches,
theories and pseudotheories, many of which have been shown by
science to be wrong or, at best, only partially effective. The
purpose of this book is to initiate a big clear-out of myths about
learning and education, for everyone involved in the educational
process: teachers, schools, parents, boards of education,
educational policy-makers and politicians. (Ch. 1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the book’s broad sweep, not every section will be useful to an
educator, though they may prove useful in arguments with the people
controlling educational funding.</p>

<p>As an appetizer, the authors begin with a critique of
<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">“Maslow’s Pyramid”</a>
[link to an example of the myth, not the book’s critique]. I write the
name in quotes because this book’s authors point out that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maslow never represented his hierarchy as a pyramid,</li>
  <li>at the end of his career, he added two new layers that are typically
not included in the five-layer diagrams of “his” pyramid, and</li>
  <li>extensive research since his death in 1970 has demonstrated that his
hierarchy does not in fact describe the structure of human needs and desires.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this as preface, successive chapters tackle myths from several
big topics in education:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Myths about learning</li>
  <li>Neuromyths, regarding supposed “innate” features of the human mind</li>
  <li>Myths about technology in education</li>
  <li>Myths about educational policy</li>
</ul>

<p>followed by a concluding chapter about the persistence of myths and
how the reader can avoid falling prey to myths.</p>

<p>The opening paragraph
of the final chapter is an apt summary of all three books I’ve
discussed in this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to implement valuable ideas from educational research into
practice, the educational sciences must be driven by theories, not
by simple observations. These theories must be based on strong
empirical data gained from methodologically valid experiments,
rather than legends, hypes and unsound research, and tested in
real-life settings before proceeding with large-scale
implementation. (Ch. 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taken together, they give you useful, reliable ways to think about
your class as a whole, to design individual activities in that class, and
to avoid the traps of myths presented as received wisdom.</p>
