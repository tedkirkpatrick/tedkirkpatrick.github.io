  <p><em>Sixth in a series on group decision-making, based on Ch. 10–11
of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Meetings-Work-Achieving-Decisions/dp/0761927050/">Making Meetings Work</a>.
The previous post suggested
<a href="/2018/09/16/learning-decision-crystallization">ways to learn the skill of decision crystallization</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="zooming-from-the-mosaic-to-a-few-tiles-">Zooming from the mosaic to a few tiles …</h2>

<p>The last four posts in this series have focused on Chapter 11 of
Tropman’s book, describing how to guide a group to an effective
decision.  I began by defining the
<a href="/2018/08/29/the-decision-mosaic-every-piece-in-place/">decision mosaic</a>,
the many small consitutents comprising a typical decision, called the
<em>decision elements</em>.  Of these elements, a few—often just one—set
the context for most others. This element is called the <em>determinative
element</em>. If there are several candidates for determinative element,
simply pick one.</p>

<p>Focus the group on the determinative element until a <em>discussion
round</em> has completed. Note the points made and how members support and
critique the points.</p>

<p>At the end of the round,
<a href="/2018/09/05/discussion-rounds-and-decision-crystallization/">crystallize the decision</a>. If
the group agrees on the proposed choice, refocus the group on a new
determinative element.  If the group does not accept it, start a new
discussion round focused on alternatives to previously-discussed choices.</p>

<h2 id="-and-back-out-to-the-mosaic-as-a-whole">… and back out to the mosaic as a whole</h2>

<p>At some point, perhaps in this meeting or, in the case of a
particularly complex decision, after several meetings, all decision
elements will be decided.  Now is the time to consider the decision as
a whole.  Tropman calls this final step of the decision process,
<em>decision sculpting</em>.</p>

<p>Until now, the group has proceeded one element at a time, making a
series of small choices.  The sequence of these, working on
the most consequential remaining choice as the determinative element,
has helped ensure that the choices were mutually compatible.  Yet this
only ensures a rough compatibility.</p>

<p>Recall Tropman’s metaphor of a decision
mosaic:  an arrangement of small tiles that create a coherent image
when seen as a whole. The group has spent its time ensuring that each
piece is well-seated next to its immediate neighbours but they
have not reviewed the resulting image. Now that all decision elements have been
resolved, it is time to review the whole decision.</p>

<p>Ask the group to consider all their choices as a package. Seen
together, are there small improvements or adjustments that would make
them more harmonious? Are there any missing pieces? Depending upon the
group and the decision, you may wish to let the proposal sit for a day
or a week before reviewing it. Take the time to
make the final package not just acceptable but brilliant.</p>

<p>You may be concerned that revisiting the decision will simply reignite
old controversies. Although this can happen with decisions made using
typical ad hoc, chaotic processes, decisions crafted using this
process will be remarkably stable. Every choice was supported by
several
<a href="/2018/08/13/the-best-process-for-group-decisions/">decision rules</a>,
each highlighting the needs of a different constituency.  Even groups
who did not get their preferred outcome will be comfortable with the
final decision because their concerns were heard and validated during
the discussion.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up-and-moving-on">Wrapping up and moving on</h2>

<p>Once sculpting is complete, you have a decision. Congratulations!
There will often be a genuine positivity in the group, an energy going
forward to its implementation, even an excitement. It’s a great
feeling—and once a group has experienced it a few times, they will
be eager to adopt processes that make it the likely outcome rather
than the exception.</p>

<p>In my final post in this series, I will consider how consistent use of
this process can transform an organization.  I will also tease my next
series on the topic of soft skills.</p>
