  <p><em>Second in a series about designing a professional master’s course on
 data engineering.  The first post laid out the
 <a href="/2018/10/13/data-engineering-design-space/">data engineering design space</a>. The
 next post lists
 <a href="/2018/10/23/data-engineering-prerequisites/">prerequisite operating system and networking knowledge</a>.</em></p>

<p>The draft learning outcomes for the data engineering course.</p>

<h2 id="course-summary">Course summary</h2>

<p>The one-paragraph course summary, as would be written in the
university calendar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Data engineering turns a proof-of-concept data model into an
efficient, maintainable service well-matched to running in large-scale
data centres. Such services are resilient against failure of either
their own instances or a service dependency, deployed in a controlled
way, suited for co-tenancy with services with different latency goals,
instrumented to detect performance problems, and compatible with the
data centre scheduler. Data engineering ensures that the services run
all night while the operations staff sleep all night.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h2>

<p>After completing the course, students will be able to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design space analysis:</strong> Analyze the tradeoffs inherent in a
cloud service design. Situate the design in the overall
space. Suggest likely impacts of changes that move the design in
that space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service level metrics, indicators, objectives, and agreements:</strong>
Describe the difference between each and apply the appropriate
type to a given design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Resilience and recovery:</strong> Estimate the resilience of a design to
various failures, test a service for resilience, and harden a
system to make it resilient in the face of failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Latency versus consistency:</strong> Analyze a design’s tradeoffs
between latency when all replicas are connected versus the
consistency guarantees when some replicas are partitioned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data centre operating systems:</strong> Differentiate the approaches to
managing the resources of a data centre (which can be viewed as the
operating system for a “computer” comprising the entire
centre). Configure a service to work with one or more of these
operating systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Classify the approaches to instrumenting a
system. Add instrumentation to a system to make visible a hidden
aspect of service performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consensus:</strong> Summarize the need for consensus, particularly for
service metadata. Differentiate the several algorithms and their
common implementations. Explain the relationship between the
consensus problem and consistency guarantees in the event of
replica failure.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>I consider learning outcomes both essential and unimportant.  On the
one hand, my thinking about a course is helped enormously when I define
5–8 broad outcomes for the course.  I generally follow the
categories of the
<a href="http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy">Revised Bloom taxonomy</a>
for the language of these outcomes. In particular, the Bloom
categories help me set the difficulty level that I want students
to master.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I haven’t found the resulting outcomes
useful for actually generating assignments and assessments. In
principle, the assignments and assessments for an outcome should be
determined by where it falls in the taxonomy.  In practice, I’ve never
found the categorization to provide much guidance.  I suspect that
this is typical of the fourth-year and graduate courses that I have
been teaching, where the material emphasizes integration of
previously-learned concepts.  Indeed, at course end, I often have
difficulty relating the <em>actual</em> content of the course to the outcomes
I specified at the outset.</p>

<p>I still consider it worthwhile to develop outcomes but I don’t
necessarily observe them closely as the actual course unfolds.</p>
