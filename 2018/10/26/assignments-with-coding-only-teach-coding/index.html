  <p><em>Fourth in a series on designing a course on data engineering.  The
 previous post listed the
 <a href="/2018/10/23/data-engineering-prerequisites/">minimal operating system and networking knowlege</a>.</em></p>

<p>When designing an upper-division or graduate-level class, we often set
our learning outcomes to include higher-level concepts characterizing
systems architecture.  For example, I am designing a course in data
engineering for a professional master’s program.  This course features
such concepts as</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consistency of data in durable storage with multiple instances</li>
  <li>Effects of high-percentile (“long tail”) latencies on overall system
performance</li>
  <li>Resiliency testing via injection of anomolous messages</li>
</ul>

<p>I begin from
<a href="http://www.johnbiggs.com.au/academic/constructive-alignment/">Biggs’s rule</a>:
Learning results from <em>what the learner does</em>. The activities I ask
learners to perform should align with the way I expect them to use the
relevant knowledge after the class; my assessment of learners against
those outcomes should align with the expected use as well.</p>

<p>Set aside the issue of assessment for a moment.  The immediate
question is how shall I design the exercises to best align with the
desired outcomes?</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-outcomes-in-detail">Defining the outcomes in detail</h2>

<p>Abstract concepts in a graduate course ought to be expressed via one
of the higher-level categories of the
<a href="http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy">cognitive process dimension of the revised Bloom Taxonomy</a>,
using verbs such as “analyze”, “evaluate”, or “create”.  As is typical
with applications of this taxonomy, the level at which to categorize a
given outcome is sensitive to how we frame it. For example, consider
the learning outcome of “student will be able to profile the
distribution of latencies for a microservice”. At first, this might
seem like “analyze”, with its implication of attribution. But if the
students are asked to contrast this profile with a specified Service
Level Objective (SLO), the process is arguably “evaluate”. On further
consideration, latency profiling requires designing a test plan,
specifying input distributions, adding metrics, and creating a final
report—processes more directly fitting “create”.</p>

<p>The learning outcome could be set as any of the three verbs,
“Analyze”, “Evaluate”, or “Create”, depending upon the emphasis of the
instructor.</p>

<h2 id="from-learning-what-they-do-">From learning what they do …</h2>

<p>Having specified the detailed outcome, we can now create an activity
whose performance leads the student to that outcome.</p>

<p>A typical activity will ask the students to build
something and as part of that assignment, analyze the performance of
what they build.</p>

<p>But consider this from the Biggs perspective, that what the student <em>does</em>
is what the student <em>learns</em>.  What are students spending most of
their time doing?  Programming, of course.  Designing (well, not
really, but in a perfect course, they would design), coding, testing,
debugging, coding some more, integrating, and arguing about what to do
next and which team member needs to contribute more.</p>

<p>How much time have they spent profiling the latency? Well, they could
only do that after the system is built and almost reliable—a tiny
window at the end of a multi-week programming frenzy.  Human
memory records most clearly the activities upon which the learner spent the
most time and attention. Given how much more time they spent building
the system than instrumenting and tuning it, their strongest
memory will be programming.</p>

<p>This is reflected in how the students respond to job interviews.  When
asked to summarize what they did in class (itself a misdirecting
question, focusing the students on their activities and not on the
principles nominally guiding those activities), they will reply, “We
built a distributed system in [language X]” rather than “We measured
latency and tuned the architecture to achieve our Service
Objectives”.</p>

<h2 id="to-doing-what-we-want-them-to-learn">… to doing what we want them to learn</h2>

<p>To increase the mindshare occupied by the intended learning outcome,
we have to reduce the time spent on less relevant activities and
increase the time spent on activities directly relevant to the
outcome. In our example case, we want to reduce the time spent
programming and increase the time spent reasoning about the
performance implications of a program’s design. In fact, the key
metric is not really total time but <em>proportion</em> of time. In an ideal
exercise, students would not work particularly long but <em>all</em> their
time would be on activities directly achieving the learning outcome.</p>

<p>Brevity is a desirable property for an exercise.  Long activities,
especially those the length of a major assignment, engender
substantial fatigue and stress, which reduce the amount and quality of
learning. Pushing the real outcome to the end of such an assignment,
as occurs with an instruction such as, “Measure your system’s
performance under a sample load and write up your analysis”, means
that students engage with the most important learning outcomes
precisely when their fatigue, stress, and deadlines most work against
effective learning.</p>

<h2 id="creating-environments-for-learning-skills-of-analysis">Creating environments for learning skills of analysis</h2>

<p>If “program an X and then analyze it” is ineffective for learning the
analysis skills (and probably isn’t particularly effective at teaching
them programming skills, either), what sorts of activity are
effective? Here’s some that I’ve come up with:</p>

<dl class="dl-indent">
  <dt>Analyze a paper model</dt>
  <dd>Provide a paper design, some sample output metrics, and ask them to
evaluate the system.  This sort of exercise focuses them directly on
the theory, considering how the pieces fit together, applying
formulas, and so forth. It might be a good prologue to working with an
actual system. It has the merit that with some computational support,
the instructor can give the class several distinct cases, reducing the
risk of cheating. It is of course the only sort of question you can
pose on an exam.</dd>
  <dt>Analyze an interactive model</dt>
  <dd>The instructor can build an interactive model, which the students
can analyze.  An interactive model can have hidden complexities that
the student has to tease out, an impossible challenge to create in a
paper exercise. Every group can be given different parameters,
reducing the risk of cheating. And the system might even do some
portion of the assessment automatically.  The primary disadvantage is
the effort to create the simulation.</dd>
  <dt>Analyze a system they have already built</dt>
  <dd>In this exercise, the students instrument, analyze, and perhaps tune
a system they built in another course or earlier in the same course.
This approach has some inherent interest for students, in that they
are improving a system in which they have some investment. It also
reduces system learning for those team members who developed the
original project. It has the further merit of reducing cheating, as
every group has their own project. The biggest risk is projects that
are too buggy or poorly-designed to instrument and get usable results.</dd>
  <dt>Analyze a system provided by the instructor</dt>
  <dd>In contrast to the approach of students instrumenting their own
system, in this style the instructor provides a system for them to
instrument and analyze. This has the advantage that the instructor is
assured that the system is correct and will yield interesting analyses
at a level attainable by this class. It also helps the instructor
grade, as the results will follow one of a few known patterns.  Its
two disadvantages are the risk of cheating when every group has the
same project, as well as the effort to create such a system.</dd>
  <dt>Analyze a system selected from a public repository</dt>
  <dd>Students could be asked to analyze a system selected from
repositories such as GitHub or BitBucket. This has mostly the same
advantages and disadvantages of using a system the students had
previously developed (though the students start with no prior
experience with the code).  It has the extra disadvantage of requiring
some gate-keeping by the instructor to ensure the students pick a
system that is likely to yield an interesting analysis.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="so-what-will-i-do">So what will I do?</h2>

<p>Programming assignments are not particularly effective or efficient
ways for students to achieve non-programming learning outcomes.  But
they are one of the most efficient ways for the <em>instructor to set up
an exercise</em>. All the alternatives that I’ve listed above, with the
possible exception of paper exercises, require significantly more
pre-class system development by the instructor.  I suspect the
instructor’s ease of developing programming assignments contributes to
their persistent use in many courses.</p>

<p>I haven’t decided how to structure assignments for my upcoming data
engineering course.  This post has started my thinking about what I
might do. My time is limited before the course begins in
January 2019, so I must pick realistic goals.</p>
