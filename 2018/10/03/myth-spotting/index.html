  <p>As part of a larger project, I’m reading many articles from the
management literature. This is a very different kind of writing and
argument than I’m used to in the technical side of computing. The
management literature (including the literature on management of
computing personnel and projects) is also prone to fads, to such a
degree that Harvard Business Review has an article on
<a href="https://hbr.org/2002/10/spotting-management-fads">spotting management fads</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to fads, management theory is also prone to myths. Where a
fad is often closely tied to its major proponent, who typically
derives a steady consulting revenue from it, myths are more widely
accepted. Where the instigation of a fad can be precisely traced,
typically to a publication such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Minute_Manager">The One-Minute Manager</a>,
the source of a myth is impossible to locate. It’s just always seemed
to be there, a piece of received wisdom, and only on close examination
does the viewer start to question it: “Everyone accepts it—but has
any one <em>demonstrated</em> it?”</p>

<h2 id="an-example-myth">An example myth</h2>

<p>An example of a widely-accepted myth is the so-called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law">Yerkes-Dodson Law</a>”.
I say so-called because neither Yerkes nor Dodson codified it into a
law. As Michael Corbett recounts in his excellent paper,
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14759551.2013.815619">“Cold Comfort Firm: Lean Organisation and the Empirical Mirage of the Comfort Zone”</a>
(whose broader argument I will return to in a later post), their
experiments were published in 1908 but it was only in 1957 that
Broadhurst published a paper codifying their results as a broader
“law”. The original data from Yerkes and Dodson in fact
contradicts the typical presentation as a U-shaped graph (contrast the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law">“Original” and “Hebbian” versions</a>
of the graph on Wikipedia).</p>

<p>Yet despite this longstanding inaccuracy, management theories, such as
performance management, continue to base their recommendations on
Yerkes and Dodson’s “law” and its supposed support for a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_zone">“comfort zone”</a>. What is
it about such myths that ensures their persistence, even in the face
of well-grounded contradictory evidence, and is there anything about
the structure of such claims that suggests it might be a myth?</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-want-to-believe-myths">Why do we want to believe myths?</h2>

<p>Myths persist because they serve a need: They help people navigate
complex questions by providing easy answers that appear on their face
to be valid. When first told the typical (mis)presentation of the
Yerkes-Dodson results, that moderate stress encourages highest
performance, while too little and too much stress reduce performance,
it makes sense. We have typically had experiences where the right
stakes—neither trivial nor life-threatening but the possibility of
meaningful gains—improved our focus. We have also probably had days
where we weren’t motivated to budge from the couch and others where
the prospect of failure shrank our creativity or even froze us
outright.</p>

<p>The problem with a myth is that it only <em>conforms</em> to experience but it does
not actually <em>explain</em> it. The myth lays out a pattern into which we
can place a few experiences selected to match. The cycle is quick and
subtle:  The myth provides a pattern, we locate a few experiences
within that pattern, which we then interpret as validating the pattern
set out by the myth.</p>

<p>This approach differs from how we interpret actual, well-demonstrated
results in social psychology, such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">fundamental attribution error</a>.
In those cases, the original supporting evidence is a broad series of
experiments, covering a wide range of circumstances. When we then hear
of the principle and organize some of our own experiences according to
the pattern, we are <em>sense-making</em>, integrating the principle into our
experience, testing it out. Although we may be testing whether it is
appropriate to our life and how it may fit with our established
principles and values, we are not validating it. The validation
preceded our learning about the result, during the period of testing
in the literature.</p>

<h2 id="the-marks-of-a-myth">The marks of a myth</h2>

<p>Superficially, both well-grounded results and myths will appear to be
supported by the literature. The definitive test is to do a detailed
review of the primary literature but this is impractical: We do not have
time to track down the sources of every claim, however
widely-believed. On the other hand, brute contrarianism, the automatic
gainsaying of all received knowledge, is a dead end as well. Are there
strong surface indicators of a myth that might warn us not to take a
claim as stated?</p>

<p>I believe such markers exist. This post is a draft of my approaches to
testing a broad, widely-repeated principle to assess the likelihood
that it can guide successful action or is just a well-meaning
platitude.</p>

<h2 id="mark-1-broad-vague-terms">Mark 1: Broad, vague terms</h2>

<p>Myths traffic in broad, vague terms. In fact, myths probably require
terms that sweep the horizon, encompassing the largest possible range.
This provides an essential advantage: The myth appears to apply to any
situation, all depending upon how the viewer interprets its key terms.</p>

<p>Consider the Yerkes-Dodson “law”. Although it is frequently described
in the management literature as the effect of changes in “stress” on
“performance”, Yerkes and Dodson’s original work used the more
technical psychological concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal">arousal</a>, which has
measurable indirect correlates in heart rate and blood pressure, as
well as more direct correlates in activation of the ascending
reticular activating system. In actual fact, Yerkes and Dodson did not
measure any correlates at all, instead choosing to vary the external
stimulus, an electrical shock.</p>

<p>Varying the external stimulus was an entirely acceptable choice for
Yerkes and Dodson, given their goals and the technology of the time.
The problem enters when this experimental operationalization is
glossed as “stress” by those who want to apply it to management
theory. Although there is face value in associating greater “stress”
with an increase in electrical shock, the actual relationship is
complex. In commmon use, “stress” refers to a complex mix of
physiological and psychological characteristics. The measurements
recorded by Yerkes and Dodson provide no way to assess the level of
“stress” experienced by the mice in their experiments. Perhaps it was
a linear relationship, perhaps logarithmic, perhaps quadratic, perhaps
its form varied piecewise over several distinct ranges. There is no
way to know. This ambiguity works to the advantage of the myth-makers,
as the listener interprets the terms within their existing biases.</p>

<h2 id="mark-2-conflating-description-and-judgement">Mark 2: Conflating description and judgement</h2>

<p>If the first part of a myth is framing the relationships between
variables denoted by broad terms, the second part exploits the connotations
of those terms.</p>

<p>Mythmakers not only prefer terms sufficiently vague to be broadly
applied, they also prefer to use those terms in a manner that
conflates description and judgement. Consider the term “stress”. On
the one hand, that term is descriptive, characterizing a form of
experience, one that can even be operationalized as measurable
correlates. But it also, especially in contemporary usage, has an
emotional valence, a connotation of undesirability. Stress is
something to avoid, a situation to minimize or from which to be rescued,
and in sufficient quantity is even a risk to your health.</p>

<p>To a management myth-maker, this conflation of description and
judgement is not a problem but a <em>resource</em>. The descriptive element
implies an objective, measurable, “scientific” aspect, while the
unpleasant connotation gets the listener’s attention. “We’re talking
about <em>stress</em> after all, and who wants too much of that?”. Better
still if it can be exploited for
<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2009/10/22/the_slate_pitch_twitter_meme.html">contrarian spin</a>,
such as “Stress can be a good for you—here’s why!”.</p>

<p>Combining denotation and connotation serves another purpose for the
mythmaker as well: It reduces a complex relationship to a single
dimension.  But this post is already long enough, so I will save that
part for the next post.</p>
